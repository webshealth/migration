<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi Guys,</span>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest causes of the recent crash in Bitcoin was the latest crackdown in China. This crackdown was not only one on retail traders but also on the country's sprawling Bitcoin mining sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, these miners (who make up 65% of total hashpower) heard the strongest statement yet on the government‚Äôs stance on Bitcoin mining. Since that time, province after province has begun to ban mining outright.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to this, miners in the country were forced to close up their farms and sell off their coins in order to avoid the incoming regulations. Mining pools began to restrict Chinese IPs and limit the amount of business they did in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As these miners began to sell their coins, the price tanked along with the total hashpower on the network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, all bad right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. In fact, this is perhaps the most bullish news of the year for Bitcoin. Despite the short term impact this is likely to have on the network / price, the longer term implications for this ban are not being talked about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why, in my latest video, I explain exactly why this miner exodus from China is likely to permanently change the ecosystem for the better. To completely neuter the ‚ÄúChina FUD‚Äù and make the market more decentralised, and yes, even more green.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/iaY6MmU0C3A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìä </span><b>Portfolio Update</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üìä</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Took profit on a few of my older altcoin positions including LINK, AVAX &amp; ADA. Going to keep that in stablecoin for the time being until more attractive opportunities open up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many ask why I choose USDC and that is just because it's my personal preference. Although I have always been a tad sceptical of Tether, their recent transparency as well as Coinbase‚Äôs decision to list it, clears a lot of doubts I may have had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coins that are on my radar include the likes of MINA which has one of the most impressive protocols I have seen this year. The price has been in freefall recently which could mean attractive entry opportunities. I covered it in a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj6rNewnbrw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent video.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, updates on my portfolio are covered in my </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram Channel.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 30.89% | BTC 25.79% | USDC 11.42% | ADA 8.03% | SOL 4.41% | DOT 4.29% | YFI 3.18% | LINK 2.76% | INJ 2.64% | RUNE 1.95% | ATOM 1.44% | 1inch 0.89% | AVAX 0.82% | REN 0.63% | LIT 0.51% | DODO 0.33%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî≠ </span><b>Trends I have Noticed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî≠</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>Bitcoin‚Äôs Latest Trends</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market might be dipping, but Bitcoin is seeing serious adoption behind the scenes. As you all know El Salvador recently passed a bill which makes Bitcoin legal tender in the country. Politicians from neighboring countries in Latin America have started signaling their intentions to pass similar motions. The reason for this is simple: they do not want to be left behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs also important to note that Latin America is a region ripe for adoption of Bitcoin &amp; crypto. Years of currency crises have plagued the continent as regimes have sought to placate citizens with generous social programs. Cryptocurrency is already becoming a life saver in countries </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.dw.com/en/venezuelans-try-to-beat-hyperinflation-with-cryptocurrency-revolution/a-57219083"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like Venezuela</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why was El Salvador the first to make this move?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, having spoken to quite a few people who are aware of the president‚Äôs record, it‚Äôs perhaps less about helping his people and more about trying to distract from other scandals. Moreover, El Salvador has officially been using the dollar as a legal tender and relations between the Bukele and the US have been rocky recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bigger question is how much custody El Salvadorians will have of their Bitcoin. If Bitcoin transactions are taking place using a custodial middle man like PayPal, then is it really a revolution, or are you just replacing the banks with tech giants?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, most El Salvadorians will have a hard time affording the high transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. Luckily, Strike, the most popular Bitcoin app in El Salvador, makes use of the Lightning Network and does give users custody of their Bitcoins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin adoption isn't the only macro thing happening either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week the Consumer Price Index in the United States rose by 5% which is even higher than the recent 4.6% rise we saw in April. Moreover, if you are looking at this just on the basis of the core number (excluding food &amp; energy) it is at the highest level in the past 30 years. As you guys know, I am a massive inflation hawk and I covered this recent release more in-depth in a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider/904"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram message.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it wasn‚Äôt all plain sailing either. In line with the miner bans that I covered above, China has continued its crackdown on retail trading of Bitcoin. This week came the news that Chinese social media giant Weibo </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/107726/baidu-weibo-censor-huobi-okex-binance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has blocked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a number of influential cryptocurrency related accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has way more of an impact on retail trading in the country than the exchange ban can have. That is because these social media sites are perhaps the only way that users in the country can get information on crypto. It is not covered in the state run media and most outside news sources are heavily restricted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when it comes to the price action itself, it‚Äôs less about the news cycle and more about what the whales are doing. It‚Äôs pretty spectacular how well the Wyckoff method has predicted the recent price action of Bitcoin. As I pointed out in another </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider/898"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram message</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week, we still appear to be in the accumulation phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means that the whales are moving the markets to shake out any more of those retail investors who may be on the sidelines about whether to sell their coins. These temporary ‚Äútests‚Äù are psychological tactics. In fact, there are many more tactics that these whales use to play the markets - something I will be covering in an upcoming video.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>Parachain Auctions Going Live</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been talking about Kusama‚Äôs upcoming parachain auctions for quite some time and finally, the moment has come. On the 15th of June, we will have the first auction going live on the network. This is perhaps one of the most pivotal moments not only for Kusama but also for Polkadot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are going to be quite a few projects in the first round of auctions but those that I find most interesting include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://acala.network/karura/join-karura"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kurara (KAR):</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is the testnet version of Acala which I have talked about a few times. It will be a decentralised finance hub of Kusama which will have a number of features including an AMM Dex, crypto collateralised stablecoins and an EVM compatible blockchain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://shiden.plasmnet.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiden (SDN):</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The testnet for Plasm Network which will be a smart contract layer for Kusama. It will also be a multichain solution building bridges to various blockchains. (Ethereum, Secret Network, Cosmos)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://phala.network/en/khala/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khala Network (K-PHA):</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Testnet for the Phala network which is a privacy-preserving decentralized database with smart contract functionality. The native token for Khala is K-PHA and will be swappable 1:1 with Phala‚Äôs native PHA.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, I have actually covered both Acala &amp; Phala as two of the most interesting Polkadot tokens in a video that I did </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzqLf7Kteuk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this year.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Parachain loan offerings could be your best bet in order to get access to some of those native tokens that are being distributed. No investment is required apart from committing KSM during the auction process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, speaking of KSM, it has been going crazy over the past few weeks. This is most likely as a result of the fact that users have been trying to get their hands on KSM in order to partake in these upcoming auctions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was something that I brought up in my </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vZmJx8yv10"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusama video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that I released two weeks ago. That video was also pretty helpful as it gave you an overview of how to actually participate in these parachain loan auctions and bid for slots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you found that as a bit of a stretch and you would prefer to use a simpler centralised solution then there could be other options. It seems as if Kraken will be supporting these auctions on their exchange. It will allow their users to vote for their favourite project right there on their client dashboard. You can read about how you can participate </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://blog.kraken.com/post/9438/kraken-breaks-new-ground-with-first-of-its-kind-parachain-auction-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over here.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think that you missed out on that recent KSM rally then you may want to keep your eye on DOT. Remember, Kusama is a testnet or ‚Äúcanary‚Äù network for Polkadot. That means that if these Parachain loan auctions are a success, it will bode well for those that eventually come on Polkadot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Newbie Tips</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üîù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DCA stands for Dollar Cost Averaging, and it's something you should familiarize yourself with during times like these. Most people who have invested in cryptocurrency since the start of the year are currently in the red zone (assuming they didn't sell already of course).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because we all have a tendency to FOMO in when we see prices going up, and panic sell when we see too much FUD in the news. Your susceptibility to these emotions is heavily influenced by your investing strategy. If you threw an entire paycheck (or two or three) into a single coin when it was at its peak, you're probably feeling the pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you had DCA'd by putting just a portion of the money you plan on investing each week or each month into a basket of coins, you'd probably be in the green or at least not as much in the red. The market is giving mixed signals right now, and if you try to trade it you will probably get rekt. Just be patient and DCA. Not financial advice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can learn about some other trading mistakes you can avoid by </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeV42mB6a4o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watching my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">about that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have those coins, you will have to decide where to hold them. While most are likely to hold them on an exchange, nothing beats taking control and placing it in self custody. Even if the exchange that you are using is highly secure and the amount that you are storing is not life changing, it creates a bad habit for the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I always suggest a hardware wallet for anyone with over $1k in crypto, there are numerous free software wallets that you can use - some of which have a really strong track record. They are also really easy to set up and use. I will be covering my top 5 picks in an upcoming video!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, if you are going to store the coins in an offline wallet, make sure that you take precautions to do it securely. That includes the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are downloading it from the official website and double check the URL</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create backups of the seeds that you have created</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that you have installed antivirus to keep your PC clear of Malware</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seriously folks, holding your coins offline will take anywhere between 5-30 minutes and once you have done it, you are ready to roll for quite some time. It‚Äôs a great habit to get into especially before you start accumulating large amounts of crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span><b> Deal of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs face it, it's not been the most exciting time in crypto markets. However, one famous phrase springs to mind: You snooze, you lose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, it can be easy to switch off when markets are running slightly against us or trending sideways. However, I personally think those ‚Äòboring‚Äô times are the best to get that crypto portfolio in order without all that distracting market noise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, which crypto platform should you be looking at to get your crypto house in order?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Binance:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Done some research and uncovered a hidden gem or undervalued crypto? Well, you are going to need a top-notch exchange to get your hands on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is no secret that Binance is the top crypto exchange for hodlers and traders alike. After all, it is home to some of the best liquidity, has a newbie friendly interface and offers a plethora of different crypto products and services. Oh yeah, 100‚Äôs of different altcoins are listed there too - so it‚Äôs a bit of a one-stop crypto shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you would have thought that there would be no deals to be had for this crypto Eldorado. However, you‚Äôd be dead wrong in thinking that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve actually been able to negotiate a super special offer - which you‚Äôll find </span><b>nowhere else!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need to do is to sign up to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/binance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through my link and you‚Äôll automatically get a </span><b>20% trading fee discount</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for life! But here comes the really special part: If you deposit more than $100 in crypto or fiat, you‚Äôll get </span><b>$10 in free USDT</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - no strings attached!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chaps at Binance tell me this is </span><b>the best deal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they have been able to offer anyone and it‚Äôs a </span><b>Coin Bureau exclusive.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you probably want to grab that limited-time deal whilst you can.</span></p>

		<Title>June 20, 2021 - I‚Äôm Locked Out of YouTube!! Urgent</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were recently locked out of the main Google account that we use to administer YouTube. That therefore means that we have no access. None. Zero.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This was all because the admin tried to login to the Google account from a new IP. Despite full verification (2FA, backup emails etc), they still locked us out.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, until we can regain access to the account, no videos can be published or worked on. I am really disappointed to tell you this as I had some really amazing content in the pipes for you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime if you want to help you can retweet this </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1406604787307667467"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweet of mine</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this just further reinforces my belief in the promise of decentralised technology. I have heard from numerous other people who were in similar situations. It‚Äôs not just your email account. It could be a social media account, trading account or (in the worst case) a bank account.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why I am so positive about the future of Defi and decentralized technology. Yes, you do take the risks of holding your own keys. Yes, there is no gatekeeper who can stop someone breaking into your account. However, if you take the adequate precautions to secure your wallets / funds, no one can stop you from using it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, YouTube has the reach in order for me to get my message out. And, until this incident I have not had too many issues with the account.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I am hopeful that with your support, their support team will prioritize this and be able to recover our account so I can continue bring you even more top-notch videos on YouTube.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìä </span><b>Portfolio Update</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üìä</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can‚Äôt be bullish on Defi and not add some ETH more to my portfolio. It‚Äôs the ecosystem that is at the forefront and I hope to be bringing you my latest ETH update when we get access to the channel again.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of other movements, given that I have exposure to over three Dex projects (1inch, DODO, INJ), I am going to reduce some exposure here and close out of DODO &amp; 1inch. Will keep these in stable again.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am also considering picking up more SOL and I have my eye on FTM. Fantom has been building out a really interesting product over the past few months and I will be exploring it a bit more in an upcoming video.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, full portfolio updates are disclosed in my </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram Channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Full portfolio is:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 30.54% | BTC 26.41% | USDC 12.19% | ADA 7.90% | DOT 4.33% | SOL 4.27% | YFI 3.26% | LINK 2.76% | INJ 2.71% | RUNE 2.11% | ATOM 1.51% | AVAX 0.85% | REN 0.65% | LIT 0.50%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî≠ </span><b>Trends I have Noticed </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî≠</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>What to Make of BTC</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm going to level with you, the next few days are going to be pretty tense. As I mentioned in last week's crypto review, Bitcoin is on the verge of painting a death cross with its moving average indicators.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, a death cross is seen as a sign that the price is about to crash. However, some news outlets like </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/here-s-how-bitcoin-s-impending-death-cross-could-be-a-contrarian-buy-signal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinTelegraph</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and crypto personalities like </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1406162962692333569"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have pointed out that this can sometimes be a contrarian signal. The last two times we saw a death cross, prices actually spiked. In other words, everyone was expecting a crash, but then the opposite happened.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This ties into the Wyckoff (which I strongly recommend you learn about by </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltcnTTeDFjY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watching my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Basically, institutions know what signals the average crypto trader and investor is looking for, and they manipulate prices during key moments like this to shake out the weak hands. I know this sounds like a bit of a conspiracy, but there's data to support it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was doing research about my upcoming video about lost Bitcoin, I read </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/bitcoin-market-data-exchanges-trading"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a study by Chainalysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from last year that revealed that 96% of all crypto traders are retail (i.e. moving less than 10k USD in crypto to and from exchanges).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a whopping 86% of all trading volume in any given day is done by so-called 'professional traders' which includes institutions. Put differently, less than 5% of people participating in the crypto market account for more than 85% of the trading volume. That's a recipe for price manipulation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what comes next? Well, the Wyckoff accumulation pattern suggests that we could see a spring (a sudden dip) and this would correspond nicely to the death cross we're seeing. That said, it is possible to have an accumulation pattern without a spring.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking at something like the Wyckoff pattern, you have to focus on the general shape, not necessarily the specifics at play. I'll be covering this more tomorrow in my weekly crypto review, so hang tight.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>Crackdown Continues (Good, Bad &amp; Ugly)</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week I made </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaY6MmU0C3A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the crackdown that was taking place in China on the Bitcoin miners. I made the point about how this crackdown was driving an exodus of miners away from a region that is known to be hostile (and the source of much FUD and volatility).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that this week the trend is continuing. While Sichuan province seemed to be a safe haven for most, they got a death blow as the authorities there </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-cryptocurrency-mining-crackdown-spreads-sichuan-2021-06-19/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the miners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they had to close up shop.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After Xianjing, Sichuan is the second most consequential province when it comes to Bitcoin mining hash rate. It controls 10% of China‚Äôs hashrate (which implies over 6% of global hash rate).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But where is a spurned Chinese miner to go?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it turns out that there is some pretty safe turf for them over in the United States. Texas and Florida have been wooing these miners. According to this </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/17/chinese-crackdown-leads-bitcoin-miners-to-texas-and-florida.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video on CNBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they estimate that up to 50% of China‚Äôs hashrate could eventually end up in the Lone Star state.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned in my video last week, Texas has a power grid that is a lot greener than China‚Äôs which means that Bitcoin could be hashed in a much more sustainable way than is being done in China. It‚Äôs a win win.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, things are not all that gravy in the US. There still appears to be this emerging narrative against Bitcoin in the halls of congress. In this case, the attacks seem to be coming from those who should technically be it‚Äôs biggest ally - progressive politicians.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I find it quite disappointing that senators like Elizabeth Warren (who has often talked about the ills of banking) is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/crypto-wild-west-elizabeth-warren-b1863530.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">railing against Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a technology that was specifically developed in order to empower people. A technology that was automatically inclusive irrespective of your race, gender, creed or economic status.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs also quite alarming that she is talking up the benefits of CBDCs when these are known to be another method of governmental control. She should also not forget that with a CBDC, a centralised power can do whatever it wants with it. Today it may be your party in power, tomorrow it might be the opponent. We don‚Äôt want these dystopian tools.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And speaking of central banks, it seems as if the FED is finally beginning to wake up to the fact that inflation is anything but transitory. This has the Fed talking </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/fed-holds-rates-at-zero-projects-two-hikes-by-the-end-of-2023"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about moving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its ‚Äútapering timeline‚Äù. This is why stocks took a bit of a tumble together with Bitcoin (risk off assets usually do).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is one very important point to note here‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that the Fed has acknowledged that inflation is higher than expected, this could warp inflation expectations. The more people think that inflation is likely to increase, the more they raise prices and precipitate that inevitable inflation. This is part of the reason that the Fed had that dovish tone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But the cat is out of the bag now. Inflation hedges are in high demand. I still maintain that over the long run, Bitcoin is the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw6giyX7DhE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best inflation hedge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Newbie Tips </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You've probably noticed that there's been a huge decline in social activity around cryptocurrency content. This might give you the impression that we're entering a bear market, but this is not the case in my opinion.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now more than ever it's important to pay attention to what's been done, not what's being said. The most colorful example of this is Goldman Sachs' take on Bitcoin. Early last week, CoinDesk reported that Goldman Sachs execs were saying that Bitcoin was </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-not-a-viable-investment-goldman-sachs-says"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not a viable investment.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a few days after that it was reported that they were offering their clients the opportunity to trade </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/goldman-expands-in-crypto-trading-with-plans-for-ether-options"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH futures and options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then, on Friday, Goldman Sachs partnered with </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/galaxy-digital-will-provide-liquidity-for-goldman-sachs-bitcoin-futures-trades"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galaxy Digital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to offer Bitcoin futures liquidity for the bank.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly what's being done and what's being said are two different things. Follow the smart money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On that note, you've probably seen that whales are continuing to accumulate Bitcoin and Ethereum even with this apparent cliff we're on with the death cross I mentioned earlier. Perhaps they're dollar cost averaging, or maybe they know we're in for a fakeout. This sort of behavior can make you question yourself and your investments.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I know from experience that when I sell one cryptocurrency, I'm tempted to modify the rest of my portfolio. Then after some time I realise I should have just HODLed. This type of market is the hardest to trade, and it's best to follow the lead of my friend Mad Mike - just ignore the charts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be hard if you've invested too much, and remember that if you're having a hard time coping with crypto stress I </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTawU1SZrBY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can help with that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs be real, those crypto markets may not have been much fun over the past week. But we have to remember that things cannot go up in a straight line forever and that it is those that position themselves well in the more tricky times that tend to reap the most benefits in the good times.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, you could cashout all that crypto or adopt the ostrich technique and switch off completely from the markets until bullish sentiment comes flooding back. Or you could be proactive about things and set yourself up to take full advantage of the crypto rollercoaster when things eventually turn around - I know which approach I‚Äôd rather take.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, which crypto platforms can you be using now to help magnify those gains tomorrow?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üí∞ </span><b>Celsius:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some of you may have foreseen that markets were getting overheated, others envision crypto prices dipping lower. If that‚Äôs you; what is a fair strategy to get the most of your portfolio? Well, you could move some of your holding into stablecoins to preserve that value.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But here‚Äôs the thing. Despite how your portfolio allocation is sitting, you probably have Bitcoin, altcoins and stablecoins just sitting there in a wallet doing absolutely nothing for you. Sure you might want to do that and just hodl. Or you could put that capital to work by lending it out to earn crypto interest.</span>

<a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/celsius/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celsius</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows you to supply a plethora of </span><b>stablecoins</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which you can </span><b>earn up to 11% interest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on. Even better, you can supply </span><b>Bitcoin and altcoins</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>earn up to 17%</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">interest. Oh yeah, that interest is paid weekly and you even have the opportunity to access those funds to take advantage of those strategic opportunities in the markets once you find them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn‚Äôt seem like a bad way to put some of your crypto holding to work and earn you some returns. It also means that you get more crypto to allocate when things turn around too.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/celsius/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up to Celsius</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; </span><b>Deposit $400 To Get $50 FREE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by using the code </span><b>HODL50</b>

That‚Äôs the nightmare of most crypto traders as you have just missed out on a potentially massive trading opportunity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you could sulk and stomp your feet or you could take the more proactive approach and look to automate your trading strategies. That way those trades will execute even if you are swanning around and enjoying yourself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But how do you do that? Well, you could use a crypto trading bot. Even better, the likes of </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/3commas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3Commas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows you to test your strategies, which allows you to optimize your trading gameplan.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I still need to thank you for all your amazing support and for giving a damn about my thoughts and insights on these markets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that I never expected things to blow up like this. Honestly, I initially thought that the idea of having 10,000 subscribers would have been a marvellous achievement.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Flash forward to today and I still can‚Äôt believe how things worked out and that‚Äôs all thanks to you. So the very least I can do is to ensure that myself and my team don‚Äôt rest on our laurels and that we keep raising that bar to bring you even better crypto content.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôll do my best not to let you folks down there.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, I hope you have a great weekend!</span>

		<Title>June 27, 2021 - Don‚Äôt Miss This Boat!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If I was to tell you about a cryptocurrency that was poised to power a brand new paradigm in finance, would you be bullish? Or what about a cryptocurrency that was about to undergo one of the most radical protocol upgrades ever?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A cryptocurrency that could eventually become deflationary and thereby make it even better than ‚Äúsound money‚Äù - it would be ultrasound money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don‚Äôt know what cryptocurrency I am talking about, then here‚Äôs a clue: It makes up the most of my portfolio.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That is right, I am talking about ETH and I am even more bullish today than I was a month ago. If anything, the recent fall has given me a unique opportunity to buy the dip on ETH and that is exactly what I have been doing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that my last Ethereum video was over 2 months ago, it‚Äôs only fitting that I did an update. There has been so much that has happened in that time including more institutional updates, upcoming protocol upgrades and further evidence of whale accumulation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I dig deep into the weeds in my latest video. I cover some of the most essential news, updates and market moves - as well as throw in a few of my personal predictions on ETH.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/lANUSdHg2oc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üôèüèª </span><b>Special Thank You</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üôèüèª</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you guys no doubt noticed, we were able to regain access to the channel. Given the intense risks that exist for channel hacks, Google has really strict rules to protect high value accounts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While it was a harrowing experience, all of the messages of support that I got from you guys was just what we needed. We got so many offers to help that we were a little overwhelmed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to an extremely helpful viewer, we managed to regain access and can (hopefully) look past this debacle.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the whole experience just showed me exactly how supportive and helpful you guys are. This is what drives me to give my all in service of you and the wider crypto community!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üëÄ </span><b>Something is Up</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üëÄ</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am on a mission to spread adoption and education in the crypto space. While my influence on YouTube has grown recently, I know that it is naturally limited by the amount of people that regularly browse the Tube.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is such a limited group of people which naturally means that many are in the dark when it comes to cryptocurrency. They are forced to rely on the narrative that is constantly being spun in the mainstream news.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been following my </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@coinbureau?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the past few days, you will have seen that Macey had an idea around how we can spread that crypto adoption and knowledge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Turns out that she has taken out </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1409167483781722114"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple London Underground ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for us! A great opportunity for people to hear about crypto and the Coin Bureau, even if they have never browsed the tube.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be seeing a lot more of these over the coming days - but I just had to let you know about it today.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìä </span><b>Portfolio Update</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üìä</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes this week chaps. I am pretty comfortable with my allocation right now and there are no unique opportunities that I can spot right now - will still be keeping that USDC as dry powder.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of tokens that are on my radar - considering some more SOL (see below) as well as potentially picking up some DOT on the back of those Kusama PLOs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can follow my regular portfolio moves in my dedicated </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram Channel.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 29.58% | BTC 28.07% | USDC 13.53% | ADA 8.15% | SOL 4.36% | DOT 3.56% | YFI 2.99% | LINK 2.64% | INJ 2.23% | RUNE 1.74% | ATOM 1.40% | AVAX 0.74% | REN 0.60% | LIT 0.41%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî≠ </span><b>Trends I have Noticed </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî≠</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>The Most Traceable Cash</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since a few weeks ago when we had that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password"><span style="font-weight: 400;">colonial pipeline hack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I wondered to myself why the hackers would consider using Bitcoin as a method to receive their ill gotten gains - but they did.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That is because the Bitcoin blockchain is one of the most scrutinized on earth. Every single Bitcoin transaction is completely traceable and every movement can be traced back to a source. Be that source a hack, a ransom payment, a dark web vendor or a mixer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of the colonial pipeline hackers, the FBI was able </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/fbi-likely-exploited-sloppy-password-storage-to-seize-colonial-ransom.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to catch the funds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and secure them on a cloud server before the hackers could even move it. The blockchain auditing tools that they use are so advanced that they can even deterministically predict flows before they even land in further wallets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why when I read news this week about the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-23/s-african-brothers-vanish-and-so-does-3-6-billion-in-bitcoin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supposed rug pull</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a South African exchange, that it was only a matter of time before they would be able to locate those funds. If it was not because of the authorities, every single coin that came from that exchange would now be tainted.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also highly likely that every international exchange has now blacklisted every single address that has emanated from the exchange. They all use third party software by the likes of Chainalysis and Ciphertrace that will immediately block all funds linked to these hacks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only that, but they will immediately </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/binance-exchange-helped-track-down-clop-ransomware-money-launderers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hand over all information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about that hackers &amp; account to the authorities. The point is that given the transparent nature of the blockchain, it‚Äôs near impossible to use Bitcoin for illicit activities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a reason that those Bitfinex hackers have not been able to liquidate their haul. By some accounts, the addresses tied to the hack must be some of the most monitored on the blockchain. Every single move that is made doesn‚Äôt only have the eyes of the authorities and tracking firms on it, but </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/73048/bitfinex-bitcoin-hack-27-million"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also the media.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, it‚Äôs perhaps easier to commit crime and launder funds with physical cash than it is to do with Bitcoin. Something that most news outlets don‚Äôt ever tend to mention. But that is neither here nor there.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, this traceability of Bitcoin is good and bad depending on which lens you view it through. Firstly, it‚Äôs going to make it a lot harder for people to engage in cybercrime or money laundering with Bitcoin. This means that it will be less threatening for broader adoption as retail investors and institutions know that stolen Bitcoin is not necessarily lost forever.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also mean that we are likely to see a lot less headlines talking about the millions lost in a hack here or a ransomware attack there. It will be one less excuse for the politicians to start banging on about Bitcoin regulation and restrictions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, this complete transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain is not entirely positive. While it‚Äôs great that people are able to use it to stop cybercrime, the tools can also be used for nefarious purposes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have very little privacy when it comes to your transactions. It is the antithesis of what Satoshi envisioned when he thought about private and peer-to-peer digital cash.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I am in two minds about this tracking ability. It makes the space safer, but it also makes it less private.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, there are a number of privacy coins that have developed some pretty advanced tech to be able to deal with this. One of the most prominent is of course Monero - a project </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O58STfvxZnY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that I have covered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on numerous occasions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, privacy coins have their own adoption challenges - but that‚Äôs a topic for another day.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>Solana Looking Sunny</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚òÄÔ∏è</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have talked about Solana quite a few times on the channel and, of course, hold it in my personal portfolio. However, I wanted to go over some of the most compelling investment cases I have seen for this blockchain.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, if you don‚Äôt know what Solana is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA1kA5yT1Ac"><span style="font-weight: 400;">then the video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I did about a 1 month ago should help inform you a bit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I covered in the video, the Solana blockchain is one of the most advanced I have seen recently. Their use of a unique consensus mechanism makes it one of the most scalable smart contract chains that I have seen so far.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, something else that I think is far more consequential than that is the immense backing that is behind this project. This backing is not only able to help increase development on Solana but also its broader awareness.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you may know, Solana Labs recently raised over $314m from a number of VC funds in order to help develop its ecosystem. It will help to speed up those projects that are already building on top of it as well as fund new projects that are looking for the best blockchains to build on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are a number of other blockchains that have their own development funds, none are as large as those that I have seen Solana raise. If it is adequately deployed, it can be a neat incentive to encourage developers who have built on other chains to port over to Solana.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This also brings me onto the broader point of projects with funding. There may be a blockchain that has superior tech, but if they can‚Äôt get developers to take a leap of faith and build on it, they will always languish.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if a project is backed by a large pile of cash, it will make it a lot easier to smooth over that adoption and developer building.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the tech has to be there. You can only fund projects for a certain period of time until they realise that the underlying technology is lacking - looking at you Eos‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to Solana, I think they have both.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There has already been a great deal of development taking place on Solana. For example, FTX is building the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://dex.projectserum.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serum Dex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here which is looking to become one of the premier scalable decentralised exchanges.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently, you have also had the news that Solana was chosen as the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/109497/digital-assets-tokenized-stocks-solana-ftx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain of choice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Digital Assets AG in order to tokenize these stocks. These stocks will then be traded on the FTX exchange.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess you saw the connection?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep, Solana appears to be the blockchain of choice for the FTX / Alameda research stable. These guys are some of the most prolific investors in the space and FTX has been on a marketing drive the likes of which you </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/crypto-industry-to-get-first-major-us-stadium-with-miami-dade-county-approving-ftx-for-heat-home.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have never seen.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point I am trying to make is that you should not be ignoring the capital or companies that are backing a project. So long as it has tech to rival the rest, it is possible it could come out on top - something I will be covering in an upcoming video.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I hold a number of ‚Äúcompeting‚Äù Ethereum blockchains each with their own advantages, but none have the firepower of Solana.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Newbie Tips </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Countries around the world seem to be </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/ba03469c86f34546bd25faf414730733#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cracking down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on cryptocurrency exchanges. This can be a bit frightening, but it's nothing new. If you ask me, all these governments are just trying to get a slice of the pie. They're desperate for tax dollars, and this can be seen in all of the lawsuits they've launched against crypto projects.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, you should check to make sure that you're not in a jurisdiction that's at risk of having this sort of crackdown. The last thing you want is to have your ability to trade cut off. Think about alternative exchanges that you could potentially use, and remember to have multiple fiat on/off ramps for your crypto holdings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the potential for restricted trading, this is just best practices in general. You never want to have one single point of failure that could potentially limit your cryptocurrency trading. The same can of course be said about seed and private seed backups.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn‚Äôt even about just a newbie mistake. Even cryptocurrency custodians and companies with over $70 million in ETH forget this rule with </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/109277/staking-company-serves-fireblocks-with-a-lawsuit-over-private-keys-to-over-75-million-in-eth"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disastrous consequences.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Related to the first point, if you happened to panic sell during the dip this week, remember that this is probably a taxable event that you'll need to keep track of. Even though you might have sold at a loss, if you had realized a gain earlier you might still find yourself owing a bunch of tax. You can learn more about some </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMNSwa_PkkA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">useful tax tips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by watching my video about that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you bought prior to 2021, you're probably not feeling too good right about now. If this is your first big dip, then welcome to crypto! Stuff like this is normal, and it's not the end of the world by any means. It's hard to lose sight of that when you're being bombarded by FUD from every angle.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that cryptocurrency is a revolutionary industry, much like the early days of the internet. Those who play the long game are always the ones that win in these sorts of environments.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You need only look at the experience of the Dot Com era. Yes, it flushed out a lot of the really subpar internet companies, but what emerged has gone on to dominate corporate America (Amazon, Google, Apple etc). This is how I view the crypto markets. Back a strong project you believe in and the long term fundamentals will bear out in future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span><b> Deals of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúBe greedy when others are fearful‚Äù is the famous phrase uttered by the legendary investor Warren Buffet. Yes, that chap doesn‚Äôt like crypto too much. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean we cannot learn a thing or two from his pearls of wisdom and apply that to crypto markets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the aim of the game is to buy low and sell high. Given that markets are down about 50% from their all-time-high, it might be a good time to start increasing that crypto position to reap the benefits of the next upswing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what crypto platforms should you be looking at to take advantage of the current market conditions? Well, I have a thought or two on that!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üí∞ </span><b>Blockfi:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Let‚Äôs be real, most of us have crypto sitting in some hardware wallet like </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/trezor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The problem is that it‚Äôs doing absolutely nothing for us and not earning a single Satoshi. What many people don‚Äôt know is that you can supply cryptos like BTC and Ethereum to crypto lending platforms like </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="http://blockfi.mxuy67.net/NKNqW7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockfi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>earn crypto interest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whilst still retaining price exposure to those crypto assets!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockfi, runs one of the most popular crypto lending platforms out there and you can </span><b>get up to 8.6% APY</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on that crypto. Not too shabby when you think about the interest rates available at your local bank.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, Blockfi is a centralized solution and I certainly wouldn‚Äôt keep all my crypto there. However, it might not be a bad idea to take a portion of your portfolio and earn some crypto interest whilst you are waiting for those markets to get hot again!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="http://blockfi.mxuy67.net/NKNqW7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up to Blockfi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; get up to </span><b>8.6% crypto interest + a bonus up to $250 when you dep $100 or more!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Kucoin:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Realistically, it is unlikely that you‚Äôll get those crazy return multiples from super established cryptos like BTC or ETH. After all, they already command gigantic marketcaps. That‚Äôs why so many people are interested in dabbling in more exotic altcoins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But if that‚Äôs your cup of tea, where do you go to get them? Well, I personally use </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/kucoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kucoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for that very purpose. Even better, I‚Äôve been able to secure you guys a very special deal there too!</span>

		<Title>July 4, 2021 - Is This The Biggest Crypto Risk??</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth of stablecoins over the past year has been monumental. The total market cap has almost tripled as companies such as Tether, Circle, Paxos and many more have been minting coins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The total market cap of all outstanding stablecoins is now over $100 billion. Not only that, but stablecoins are fundamental to crypto market liquidity. More crypto is traded against stablecoins than is traded against other fiat.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This has left many concerned about the reliance of crypto markets on stablecoin volumes. More specifically, if there was ever a clampdown or ‚Äúrun‚Äù on stablecoin redemptions, could the issuers still meet them?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Or what happens if there was ever a confidence crisis in one of the stablecoins and the market tried to dump it?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are questions that have been asked but not really answered. This is because it is extremely hard to determine what could happen in a ‚Äútail risk‚Äù event like this. We have never had a crisis like this and crypto markets have never been stressed by stablecoin contagion.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So in my video today, I talk about the stablecoin market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I give you an overview of how it is currently positioned and how regulators, exchanges and other market participants are viewing its rise. I analyse the potential risks out there and dive into accusations of market manipulation - all your questions answered.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/Q3tunUaDwN0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìä </span><b>Portfolio Update</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üìä</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Decided to pull the trigger on some more SOL. As I covered last week, by being one of the most well funded ecosystems, Solana has a lot of firepower to brute force adoption of its revolutionary tech.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No other changes apart from that. I may consider adding to my ETH stack depending on how things progress with the London upgrade.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, you can follow my daily moves in my only </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">official Telegram channel.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 32.68% | BTC 26.48% | USDC 10.69% | ADA 8.12% | SOL 5.39% | DOT 3.40% | YFI 3.07% | LINK 2.57% | INJ 2.52% | RUNE 1.77% | ATOM 1.56% | AVAX 0.74% | REN 0.61% | LIT 0.40%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî≠ </span><b>Trends I have Noticed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî≠</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>Bitcoin‚Äôs Biggest Tests</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the biggest tests for Bitcoin this year are playing out in front of our very eyes. This also has nothing to do with price but more about adoption and network security.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first of these has to do with the country wide experiment that is taking place in El Salvador. I covered the Latam adoption in much more depth in a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvtQ11kg-Hs&amp;t=1s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent video of mine.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, one of the most interesting steps in El Salvador so far was the recent announcement that every citizen was eligible for a $30 Bitcoin airdrop from their government. All they needed to do in order to claim this was download the government‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet app.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy concerns aside, the interesting test here will be to see how many people actually accept it. Not only that, but it will also be quite telling to see how many of those that do claim it actually end up using it as a medium of exchange.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be the ultimate comparison where people will have the option to either pay in Bitcoin or USD. Which methods they decide to start using could help us determine whether Bitcoin as a global currency could ever work at scale.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the move by El Salvador to make Bitcoin a legal tender, I have seen two opposing viewpoints. Some claim that it won‚Äôt be picking up because transactions are too slow and expensive. Others show the extent to which cryptocurrency is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-bitcoin-transfers-surge"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already being used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pay for goods and services.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I will be watching those usage stats quite closely over the coming months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next Bitcoin test that we have relates to network security. I am of course talking about the current mining landscape and how quickly it can adapt.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I have covered on numerous occasions, I think that the Chinese Bitcoin Mining ban will be good for the ecosystem. In the long term it will mean that the network will be less susceptible to China FUD - feel free to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaY6MmU0C3A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watch my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, in response to the crackdown, Chinese mining farms have been closing down their operations at a breakneck pace. Check out this image of one farm that is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://i.redd.it/s88ptvxhet771.jpg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">packing up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its ASIC mining rigs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in response to the shutting down of all their mining operations, there has been a monumental fall in hashpower. A fall was always expected but just how large - no one knew. You can see the full scale of the drop in </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://prnt.sc/189evv7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this chart.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Bitcoin network was designed, mining difficulty has to adjust in order to bring more marginal miners into the fold. We have just had the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-largest-drop-in-history"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest drop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Bitcoin‚Äôs history.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the question now is - how long before hash rate returns? Will it incentivise marginal miners to start their rigs? Will the reduced cost of mining make other regions more cost effective? Will this further drive Chinese mining companies to these regions?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be one of the biggest tests of the Bitcoin network to date. One that I will of course be keeping a close eye on!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>Binance Crackdown Continues</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance is the king of exchanges. There is no doubt about it. However, more recently it has come under a lot of scrutiny in numerous locations around the world. This is not because of the fact that it has done anything wrong. However, it seems to have been a victim of its own success.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance launched back in 2017 in a cryptocurrency sector that was still relatively new. A sector that was mostly dominated by retail traders and whales. One where regulations around crypto assets were sparse and contradictory.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, given how quickly Binance has grown, it has run up against the boundaries of which it can operate without treading on regulatory toes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs take a look at some of those regulatory announcements over the past 2 weeks‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, you had news coming out of Japan that said Binance is not registered to operate in their country. This is mainly because of the fact that Binance does not hold a license to operate in Japan.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, about a week ago, you had the announcement by the FCA that Binance is not legally allowed to operate in the UK. Turns out that this only </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1409229415846981634?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applied to their UK entity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which was supposed to launch as Binance UK. However, this announcement did disconcert a few people.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then you had </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/thailand-sec-files-criminal-complaint-against-crypto-exchange-binance-2021-07-02/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the Thai SEC has filed a criminal complaint against Binance. Similarly to the Japanese warning, this was mainly because Binance was seen to be operating an exchange in the country without the requisite licences.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, just yesterday you </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-cayman-island-exchange-business-no-license"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the Cayman Islands regulators have said that Binance is not registered on the island and as such, they are not ‚Äúauthorized by the Authority to operate a cryptocurrency exchange from or within the Cayman Islands‚Äù.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do you notice is the common thread here?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the fact that Binance does not have the requisite licences. That therefore means that the only thing that is required is to obtain them. This is something that Binance has already done for </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/singapore-to-follow-up-with-binance-in-wake-of-global-crackdown"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their Singaporean</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> company. They have applied for a license to provide ‚Äúdigital token services‚Äù.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may of course be asking why they had not done this in other countries before the crackdown?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I can only assume it is because crypto specific laws did not exist yet. And, if they did then they were contradictory and the application process itself was incredibly laborious and convoluted. Countries like Singapore have made the process incredibly simplified (one of the reasons they have so many crypto businesses based there).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, these recent actions have now forced Binance‚Äôs hand and they will have to go through these application processes. It is my guess that they are likely to get a whole bunch of licences for different companies. If there are particular instrument / token restrictions in these respective countries then they may operate a separate Binance branded exchange - similar to Binance US.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Irrespective of what Binance does decide to do, this just shows how tough it is going to be for centralised exchanges to continue operating globally. This is also one of the reasons that CZ himself is so bullish on DeFi and DEX‚Äôs. For example, CZ himself has said that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-ceo-defi-cannibalize-crypto-exchange"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he fully expects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Defi to cannibalise his exchange. It‚Äôs also not a coincidence that there has been </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1410998340918018048"><span style="font-weight: 400;">so much focus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Binance on BSC.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, decentralised exchanges are nowhere near newbie friendly. There are risks that come from using a platform that has no stopgap or user protections. There are risks that come from taking full control of your web wallet and performing decentralised swaps. They need to be more intuitive and better understood - part of the reason I do what I do.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is that the landscape is changing. If a juggernaut like Binance is finding the operating conditions tough, you can bet that other exchanges will also be in similar positions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two alternatives I see are you can either apply to be compliant, or you can decentralise. They appear to be trying to do both.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Newbie Tips </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not just regulators that are likely to throw a spanner in the works when it comes to using your preferred crypto exchange - it‚Äôs also the banks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been numerous reports of banks making it difficult to fund &amp; withdraw crypto from exchanges. This includes banks </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/06/19/tsb-crypto-ban-54m-customers-fraud-fears/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here in the UK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as TSB, Barclays, </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/03/cryptocurrency-scam-online-dating-covid-binance-grindr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monzo and Starling bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Further afield, there have also been banks down in South Africa that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/south-african-banks-blocking-crypto-trading-on-international-exchanges"><span style="font-weight: 400;">block funds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I am sure that there are a number of other countries that are making it similarly difficult.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point of the matter is that you need to make sure that you still have smooth and functional fiat-crypto on/off ramps. I hope by now that you've cashed out at least a few times even just to make sure that it's possible. As with exchange accounts, it's a good idea to have multiple entry and exit points for fiat to crypto, and one of my personal favorites is cryptocurrency debit cards. These include the likes of crypto.com, Binance etc.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you might be wondering - what's going on with the market right now and what comes next? I'm still of the opinion that this bull market isn't over, and we're just in a Wyckoff accumulation phase (</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltcnTTeDFjY&amp;t=1s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watch this video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you have no idea what that is).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My strongest evidence of this comes from other macro factors, namely the fact that the stock market continues to hit all time highs. Crypto is more correlated to stocks than ever, so how can we have all time highs in one while the other stagnates?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy: manipulation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I've noticed that we're seeing a lot of commonly used crypto trading models and technical analysis methods being completely violated. I'm referring specifically to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan B's stock to flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which seems to be getting more incorrect by the day, and this is obviously spooking a lot of people who put a lot of faith in that model.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than completely do away with the Stock To Flow or TA, consider for a moment that what you're seeing is a low resolution image of institutional buying and selling behavior. As a friendly reminder, over 86% of daily trading volume comes from large investors </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/bitcoin-market-data-exchanges-trading"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Chainalysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If this is true, the thought that little fish like you and me could influence price is a bit ridiculous. It's something that's outside of our hands, and that's pretty terrifying but also liberating.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Wyckoff said, just watch the market like it was all the actions of a single person pulling the strings behind the scenes. What‚Äôs really interesting is that if you look closely enough, you can see that some of these investors are sending signals to themselves behind the scenes. If they conspired behind the scenes to manipulate, that would of course be illegal. But if that information is out in the open for everyone to access, it‚Äôs not.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here's </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://dailyhodl.com/2021/06/27/jp-morgan-remains-bearish-on-bitcoin-expects-major-capitulation-at-this-key-price-level/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interesting article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I found that suggests BTC could drop back down to the 25k range. This would coincidentally correspond to the spring phase in Wyckoff's accumulation pattern.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the point I am trying to make is that there is a lot more to the markets right now than meets the eye.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs been a pretty good week for crypto markets. But here‚Äôs the question: are you all set to take maximum advantage of that potential next leg up?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, a wise man once said: ‚ÄúYou may have the opportunity of a lifetime, but the trick is to make money in the lifetime of the opportunity‚Äù.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what crypto platforms should you be looking at to maximize your portfolio? Well there are a couple I am leveraging myself, right now!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üíµ </span><b>Celsius:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Are you holding Bitcoin or altcoins waiting for the price to be sent into the stratosphere? Well, you have two options:</span>

<b>1)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can just store them in a hardware wallet and have that crypto sitting there doing nothing.</span>

<b>2)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Or you could put that crypto to work on a crypto lending platform. This gives you continued price exposure to the crypto markets and </span><b>earns you interest whilst you wait!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So yep, you can get even more crypto that way.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in option two, then you might be interested to know that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/celsius/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celsius</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">offers up to </span><b>6.2% interest on BTC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>up to 13.99% on altcoins</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, if you are sitting on </span><b>stablecoins</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can </span><b>earn 8.88% interest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on them whilst you wait to unearth that gem of an opportunity - pretty handy!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even better, if you deposit $400 on Celsius you get </span><b>$50 FREE!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just use the code: </span><b>COINBUREAU</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/celsius/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign Up To Celsius</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To Earn Crypto Interest &amp; </span><b>Get $50 FREE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When You Dep $400+</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üí∏ </span><b>Best Way To Buy Crypto With Fiat:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maybe you are not content with your exposure to crypto markets and want to top up that portfolio? Well, if you are living in Europe, UK, Canada, Singapore and Switzerland then the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/swissborg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swissborg app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is probably the solution you are looking for.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve been personally using Swissborg for a while now and I have to say the app is amazingly simple and easy to use. I was also blown away when I cashed out a bit of crypto and discovered it had landed in my bank account within five minutes. So yep, if you are looking for a way to get in and out of crypto, then you definitely need to try this out!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if you deposit ‚Ç¨50 you‚Äôll get up to </span><b>‚Ç¨100 in CHSB tokens for FREE!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/swissborg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign Up To Swissborg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; </span><b>Get Up To ‚Ç¨100 FREE</b>

		<Title>July 11, 2021 - Crypto Myths People STILL Believe!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no doubt that we have come a long way in terms of crypto awareness, adoption and general education. However, despite how much is known by the general public, there are certain crypto "myths'' that exist.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Falsehoods that are believed by far too many people - some of which are even believed by seasoned crypto traders and investors.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By believing in these myths, some investors are either not investing in cryptocurrency at all or if they are, are going about it all wrong.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in my video today, I take a look at the Top 10 crypto myths. I break them down and explain how they came about and why they are myths exactly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I also dish out some top tips that could better help you guys understand how these crypto markets move and how to avoid some common pitfalls.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, this is a video that you definitely do </span><b>NOT</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want to miss. You can watch it </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/dFmAZZYAJz0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìä </span><b>Portfolio Update</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üìä</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Didn‚Äôt make any changes this week. As I mentioned in my video today on crypto myths, I don‚Äôt like to overtrade. Keeping that chunk of USDC for strategic opportunities that may present itself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those that I currently have on my radar are INJ, &amp; DOT. INJ because the mainnet appears to be on the horizon and they just launched staking functionality. DOT because the Kusama PLOs are going well and it‚Äôs a look at what could happen on Polkadot when they go live there.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Will of course keep you guys fully updated with my market moves in my official </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram Channel.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 31.58% | BTC 26.53% | USDC 11.22% | ADA 7.97% | SOL 5.16% | DOT 3.49% | YFI 3.22% | LINK 2.61% | INJ 2.55% | ATOM 1.94% | RUNE 1.83% | AVAX 0.80% | REN 0.62% | LIT 0.48%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî≠ </span><b>Trends I have Noticed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî≠</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>What‚Äôs Going On??</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's been a bit of a wonky week in the crypto market to say the least. While I'm sure stuff like the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-09/binance-booms-as-nomad-crypto-exchange-outside-nations-reach"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance crackdown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is playing a role, there is a lot of really intense stuff going on at the macro level.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the FED released minutes (fancy word for summary) of its meeting in June, and what they said seems to have spooked the markets as a whole. This is because they're thinking of </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/561924-fed-minutes-show-growing-debate-over-when-to-pull-stimulus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing interest rates.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing interest rates is bad news for anyone who's overleveraged (borrowed too much money to invest). I am sure that you know many people who have personally overleveraged themselves on mortgage / credit card debt, but they have also been doing this when it comes to general investing. </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/06/16/margin-debt-and-the-market-up-1-7-in-may-continues-record-trend"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margin debt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continues to post record highs as investors borrow to buy stocks, real estate, and yes, even crypto.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The other macro factor is one that I hate to discuss but can't ignore, and that's the apparent continuation of this pandemic thanks to the so-called Delta variant. It's looking likely that we'll be seeing more lockdowns across the board this fall, and </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/jim-cramer-blames-market-sell-off-on-failures-to-contain-delta-spread.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investors are bracing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for what could be another crash similar to last March.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we saw in that last lockdown crash in March, it took the crypto markets with it. They are highly correlated and when institutional investors are fleeing to so-called ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù assets, they sell everything perceived as risky. I personally don‚Äôt think we will have such restrictive lockdowns again and, even if we do, there is less uncertainty than there was in the first one.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even if we face rolling lockdowns in Europe / the Americas, the good news is that those government printing presses and stimmy cheques are at the ready. While I know that this decimates fiat savers and the like, it is a boon for the long term demand for cryptocurrency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, before the fall comes, we've got so much bullish news on the horizon. Ethereum's EIP 1559 upgrade is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1412645174535241731?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set to hit mainnnet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on August 4th, Cardano is supposed to roll out it's smart contracts in August as well, and I have a gut feeling we're going to see parachain slot auctions on Polkadot by that time too.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And just a quick word about all that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-stablecoin-firm-circle-to-go-public-in-4-5b-blank-check-deal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stablecoin FUD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we've been seeing from China et. al. As I mentioned in </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3tunUaDwN0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my recent video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can't exactly ban stablecoins. They will keep trading hands regardless of what regulators do, and it's clear that not all regulators share the same negative sentiment. If they did, they wouldn't have given the green light to Circle's SPAC IPO, which is bound to turn some heads in traditional finance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>The Adoption Dilemma</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a serious dilemma that we have in the crypto sector right now. We have a situation where regulators, politicians and central banks want to tighten the screws, introduce new rules and increase oversight of the crypto sector. You need look no further than all of those exchange crackdowns that I talked about above.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, there are two viewpoints as to why they are doing this. The first explanation (and the one given) is that they are trying to protect consumers from scams and other nefarious activity. They are trying to provide a regulatory framework that can protect retail investors and consumers who could get financially harmed by these assets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is a more cynical viewpoint and that is that they want to control it as they view it as a threat to their centralised power.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am personally in-between both of these. While I am not completely of the view that these individuals have our best interests at heart, they do have a point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of scams, hacks and other nefarious activities taking place in crypto. If newbies are not getting rekt in reckless leveraged trading, they are throwing their money at a ponzi scheme, giveaway scam or just a garden variety shitcoin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I even have a first hand account here. You would have no idea how many of my followers still fall for scams impersonating me. This despite a disclaimer in *every single* video I push.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot have mass adoption of cryptocurrency unless we make it less threatening and more beginner friendly. We cannot have a situation where users are constantly falling for these scams and needlessly losing money in the space.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, do we need more burdensome regulation in order to achieve those ends? It seems like one of the only options being pursued at the moment. When Barclays decides to restrict all deposits to Binance, they do stop those 1% of users that are about to make a reckless financial decision.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, they also restrict the ability of the other 99% who want to use it legitimately, from doing so. We are the collateral damage in their "mission" to protect beginners.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's not just banking services though. It's everything from wallets to exchange features and payment service providers. They want to limit the functionality of cryptocurrency for these beginners so that they can't make the mistakes they would do if they had full control.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is that that is exactly what crypto is about - full control of your own finances. And, this control does of course come with the responsibility and risks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what is the solution? The status quo is far from ideal and the alternative is really suboptimal.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer, in my view, is education!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The more that people know about how to use cryptocurrency, how to invest and what to avoid, the less likely we are to have these headlines. The less likely we are to face intense calls from the regulators.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was once a beginner in the crypto space. We all have had our fair share of faux pas and mistakes. We have all learned our lesson the hard way.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it is our duty as seasoned practitioners to help educate those new to the space and help them avoid those land mines or pitfalls. The more we do that, the less likely we are to go down this path of overburdensome regulation and governmental overreach.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the primary reason why I do what I do, and I hope to continue doing so for as long as I can - but the more of us out there doing it, the better!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Newbie Tips</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üîù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's difficult not to be disconcerted by all of these Binance crackdowns. As one of my favourite exchanges, I was also incredibly angry when my bank (Santander) recently decided to stop deposits there. They gave the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1413369942745956356?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same patronising reason</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as to why they did this.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, although I am convinced that Binance will confidently bounce back (as explained in last week's newsletter), this is a good time to start self custodying and diversifying.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By self custodying, I mean you should be taking the bulk of your funds off of exchanges and keeping them in a hardware or software wallet (preferably hardware). I </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t3Brlb0qzQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the top hardware wallets which I did earlier this year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By diversifying, I mean you should be creating other exchange accounts. Consider another fiat on or off-ramp that is fully set up and ready to go. As I mentioned in this </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider/957"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a good one to consider for those in Europe and the UK is of course Swissborg. However, Coinbase and Bitstamp seem to also have strong fiat support.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you been reading the news lately? I can't help but notice that the view counts on CoinTelegraph articles are incredibly low. Sucks for CoinTelegraph, but it's even worse for all the people checking out of the crypto market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm going to go ahead and assume you've been keeping up if you're subscribed to this newsletter, but if you haven't, I seriously recommend doing so. You need to stay up to date with what's going on because there's only so much I can cover in my weekly crypto review. Remember not to take those headlines to heart, though.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your pocket is hurting more than usual because of the crypto market, consider finding a crypto job. The crypto job market is as hot as ever, and the other day I saw a job posting on Twitter that was pretty damn interesting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum's Name Service </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/ensdomains/status/1411042729245687809"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is looking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a 'Governance Lead'.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Requirements? Experience participating in DAOs, mainly. That's something that I'm sure some of you have done in the past, and it's just a sneak peek at the novel jobs we're going to see emerging from the crypto market over the next few years and beyond. Keep your eyes peeled, there's opportunity out there.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh and if you have no idea what Ethereum's Name Service is, you should watch </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyy6hUhLLg8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Unstoppable Domains (who </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/jobs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are also hiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the way).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to optimize! I can‚Äôt think of a truer saying when it comes to crypto. The truth is that most crypto millionaires didn‚Äôt get there by merely throwing in a hundred thousand dollars into an altcoin. Many started with way less money and took advantage of small opportunities offered by these markets at the right time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those types of marginal gains tend to add up, compound and multiply over time. Indeed, I am a big fan of </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marginal gain theory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it comes to supercharging that crypto portfolio in the long term. Studies into this theory have shown that the result is very big gaps between those who make slightly better decisions and those that don‚Äôt - I know what side of the fence I‚Äôd rather be on!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But how can you do that? Well, here are a few platforms that you can use to get small gains and to get an edge on the markets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üí≥ </span><b>BlockFi Credit Card:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Let‚Äôs face it; we all have boring monthly expenses that add up to a couple of thousand dollars a month. Most people whack that on a debit card and get NOTHING in return. However, smart people could use the </span><b>NEW BlockFi crypto credit card</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>earn crypto cashback</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on money you would have spent anyways!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note, that I am not a fan of debt and personally pay off all my credit cards every month. Do that and you can enjoy those credit card perks for free!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what should you consider that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://blockfi.mxuy67.net/c/2230464/1080104/10568"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new BlockFi credit card?</span></a>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Earn 3.5% BTC cashback</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the first 3 months.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That cashback means that expenses actually become investments.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>No fees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use the card, No annual fees and no foreign transaction fees.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-approval doesn‚Äôt impact your credit score.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">BlockFi is rolling out their crypto credit card in the US first and you can be first in-line to get your hands on that by joining the waitlist. It‚Äôs also the very first crypto credit card I have heard of too!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://blockfi.mxuy67.net/c/2230464/1080104/10568"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join The Waitlist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For The </span><b>BlockFi Crypto Credit Card</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Now!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what else do these BlockFi chaps offer to help you get even more marginal gains? Well, it so happens that they are home to one of the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://blockfi.mxuy67.net/NKNqW7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">biggest crypto lending platforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> too. Here you can earn‚Ä¶</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to 4% APY on BTC</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to 4% APY on ETH</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to 8.5% on stablecoins</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people just let those crypto holdings sit in a wallet and earn nothing. Others look to get those marginal gains whilst still getting exposure to the crypto markets by using crypto lending solutions like BlockFi.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://blockfi.mxuy67.net/NKNqW7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign Up To BlockFi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; Get Up To </span><b>8.5% Crypto Interest!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ü¶æ </span><b>CryptoHopper: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto markets never sleep and it can be hard to gauge how successful that crypto trading strategy really is. Most people just take shots in the dark and miss epic market moves in their sleep. However, others say no to all that and see it as an opportunity to get some marginal gains, where others do not!</span>

		<Title>July 18, 2021 - Is 100k Bitcoin Still Possible this Year?</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people have been asking me if it is still possible for Bitcoin to reach 100k this year. It‚Äôs a reasonable question to ask, especially thanks to one of the most popular Bitcoin pricing models of all time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am of course talking about the Stock-to-Flow model. The model that has been touted as one of the most accurate predictors of a long term ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù Bitcoin price.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, recently the price has begun to diverge from the model. So much so that this is the most inaccurate that it has been in years (even more so than in 2019). This has many wondering whether the model was really that accurate from the beginning. Was its perceived accuracy a mere coincidence?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, in my video today I explore just that. I dive right into the model and explain exactly what it is, how it works and what assumptions it is based on. I then analyse whether these are reasonable and whether the model is statistically sound.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I then give some of my own thoughts on the Bitcoin market and whether we really ever could see a return to 100k.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that right </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/jfjjWAmGks4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over here.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìä </span><b>Portfolio Update</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üìä</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Few small tweaks to the portfolio this week. I sold out of some LINK, RUNE &amp; AVAX. Proceeds went into buying more Bitcoin. In these current market conditions, I would prefer to be top heavy in Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum. We are more likely to see a recovery of these assets before any sort of sustained alt rally.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Projects that are still on my radar are DOT &amp; INJ. I am also keeping a close eye on some of these tokenized gaming projects including ENJ &amp; AXS. I will actually be doing a video on Axie Infinity in the coming week so you may want to keep a lookout for that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No other changes for now. Don‚Äôt forget to jump into my telegram for the daily updates you are not getting here. The link to the official channel </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is here.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 31.57% | BTC 29.34% | USDC 12.34% | ADA 7.74% | SOL 4.78% | DOT 3.13% | YFI 2.99% | INJ 2.61% | LINK 1.84% | ATOM 1.64% | RUNE 0.90% | REN 0.57% | LIT 0.54%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî≠ </span><b>Trends I have Noticed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî≠</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>It‚Äôs Worse Than Inflation</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For regular viewers of the channel, you will have seen me talk about the risks of inflation on numerous occasions. </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw6giyX7DhE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that I made a month ago, I covered the topic in depth. I also explained why I thought it was being severely undercounted and why it was only likely to continue rising.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, this week got the latest June CPI data and they are once again breaking new highs. The June inflation print was at its highest level in 13 years </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/consumer-price-index-increases-5point4percent-in-june-vs-5percent-estimate.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coming in at 5.4%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This was also much higher than most economists were expecting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It gets even worse than that. If we were to strip out food and energy to get to a ‚Äúcore‚Äù CPI, we see that it has increased by 4.5% which is the largest increase since 1993. For the past 6 months, the Fed has been trying to make the argument that this inflation is ‚Äútransitory‚Äù and nothing to worry about. However, no one is really drinking that Kool-Aid anymore.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the CEO of Black Rock </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/i-worry-about-inflation-says-blackrocks-larry-fink-warns-its-unlikely-to-be-transitory-11626275810"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it‚Äôs anything but transitory and that it worries him. For those that don‚Äôt know, these guys are the largest Asset Management company in the world. If inflation is on his mind, then it should be on our minds too.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This increasing inflation has spooked many market participants as it has reignited </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/st-louis-fed-president-bullard-says-time-is-right-for-a-fed-tapering-2021-07-13"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tapering fears</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the implications this could have on the financial markets. When the Fed starts tapering its bond buying programs, this slows down the excess liquidity in the market which reduces demand for ‚Äúrisk on‚Äù assets from stocks to crypto.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the Fed is concerned about tapering. And that is because there are signs that are beginning to appear that the economic recovery </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/us-weekly-jobless-claims.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">may be stalling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not only that, but there are now numerous fears that the Delta variant of covid could </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/the-surging-delta-variant-brings-new-uncertainty-to-the-economic-recovery-experts-warn.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">throw a massive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">spanner in the works.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what you have is a situation of increasing inflation with slowing economic growth. This deadly cocktail of unfavourable macroeconomic conditions is called ‚Äústagflation‚Äù. People don‚Äôt only have unstable incomes but their cost of living is also increasing at a rapid clip.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed is between a rock and a hard place and the market knows this. There has been a fall in ‚Äúrisk on‚Äù assets such as equities. Even Bitcoin, which is technically an inflation hedge, has fallen over the past week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if people are moving their funds out of these more risky assets, where are they investing?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, they are moving back into the relative ‚Äústability‚Äù of US government securities. The 10 year US treasury yield has been continuing it‚Äôs three month slide which means that demand for bonds is increasing. Currently, the 10 year T bill yield is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">below 1.3%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is the lowest that it has been since February.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only problem with this is that investors are losing over 4% yield in real terms (after accounting for that inflation). We have arrived at a level of financial market uncertainty where investors are paying for the security of government debt.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I, for one, don‚Äôt think that this is sustainable. Eventually, investors will have to consider potential investments in a more stagflationary world. Equities won‚Äôt be an option as slower growth will weigh on earnings. Gold has shown over the past year that it‚Äôs inflation hedge status is not watertight.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, where to invest?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it‚Äôs a topic that I will be covering in an upcoming video - so keep your eyes peeled for that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>DAO‚Äôs Incoming! But not Without Risks</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue of Decentralised community governance is one of the hottest topics in crypto. Projects have been looking for ways to outsource important decisions to the broader community.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be seen as a win-win for both the community members and the project team themselves.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the community it means that they can have a direct hand in the decisions that are being made at the project. They can also help to shape the value of the network by these important decisions (and hence increase the long term value of their gov tokens).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the project teams, by handing over control to the users, they are taking all regulatory heat off of themselves. They are no longer a centralised point control that governmental agencies can put pressure on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There have already been a number of projects in the crypto space that have begun their move to fully decentralised autonomous organisations. However, one of the most </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://erikvoorhees.medium.com/shapeshift-is-decentralizing-639bb4c82fc8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent is Shapeshift.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is perhaps one of the oldest non-custodial crypto exchanges founded by a Bitcoin OG called Erik Voorhees. They will be open sourcing the code, winding down the corporate structure and handing over control to the community who holds the governance FOX tokens.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an interesting development for the exchange. That is because Erik has </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/1346880034125066246?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">always bemoaned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the fact that he was being pressured to conduct KYC on his users. This was one of the reasons that Shapeshift removed it and went the Defi route. The most logical next step to take after that was to fully decentralise the governance of the exchange itself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at another DAO; about a month ago you had the news of </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-dao-launches-after-230m-funding-round-including-peter-thiel-alan-howard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BitDAO raising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $230 million from a number of investors in the APAC region. One of the biggest contributors to this fund was Bybit, a leveraged trading exchange. This could also be an opportunity for Bybit to diversify away from their reliance on their centralised exchange - one that is most likely to come under the same scrutiny we have seen at other large exchanges.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">BitDAO will be an investment DAO where the token holders will get to decide where funds are allocated among projects. Apart from Bybit, there are some really important backers in the pool including the likes of Alan Howard &amp; Peter Thiel.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, there seems to be an increasing shift to these methods of project governance. However, as with any new technology, they are not full proof.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, this week we also had the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/111185/harvard-law-blockchain-initiative-uniswap-dao"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap governance debacle.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Long story short, some UNI holders approved a governance initiative that saw $20m in UNI tokens being granted to a ‚ÄúDeFi Lobby Group‚Äù. Tokens that were meant to be sold over a period of 5 years. Except, it was discovered that they were dumped on the market in a single OTC trade.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/demand-for-transparency-from-defi-education-fund/13299"><span style="font-weight: 400;">main issue here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the manner in which the proposal initially passed and whether VC firms used their token voting rights to serve their own interests over that of the broader community. Of course, when one party controls a large proportion of the tokens, you will always face risks of voting in self interest</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be interesting to see how these newer DAOs will navigate these governance challenges. I am incredibly optimistic about decentralised governance but am aware of the challenges they could face.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Newbie Tip </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who follow my Twitter account, you will have </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1416083136233054210?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seen my response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the scathing tweets that the Dogecoin founder sent out.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like I said, I don‚Äôt agree with 95% of what he says. But I will admit that the crypto space can sometimes not be that welcoming to newcomers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If people ask simple questions, they are often hounded or made fun of. If they ask more insightful questions, they are told to merely ‚ÄúDYOR‚Äù. If they fall victim to a scam or a hack, they are told that it‚Äôs their own fault for falling for it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the way that we are able to build a stronger and more inclusive crypto community. That is why I was particularly pleased to see that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/111782/white-hat-hacker-saves-117000-in-crypto-from-metamask-phishing-attack"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this user</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was able to save half of his funds thanks to a white hat hacker.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite committing one of the biggest crypto mistakes there is (handing over private keys), there were some in the community willing to help (along with those more than willing to admonish).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what‚Äôs the newbie tip here?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it‚Äôs better to ask the question and be a fool for a minute, rather than a fool for a lifetime. So, never be afraid to ask questions. Never be ashamed to ask for help.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, there will be people who attempt to shame you for making silly mistakes or asking basic questions. However, there will always be people within the community who will happily help you out.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also why I try to regularly run bi-weekly AMAs </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRb55gmHr7X/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on my instagram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I usually get inundated with questions, but I try to answer them despite how elementary they may sound.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only way that we are able to counter Jackson‚Äôs narrative is by being the exact opposite of the community he is talking about.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know that crypto markets can be volatile. However, in spite of those ups and downs there is no excuse not to have a great deal and get the best value possible for your crypto dabbling.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what crypto platforms should you be looking at? Let me enlighten you‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Kucoin:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Naturally, anyone building a crypto portfolio needs a top notch exchange. However, Kucoin offers way more than just being the home of exotic altcoins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They also offer a completely free crypto trading bot. I talked all about that one in my recent </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye3nUsbegGI&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto trading bot video here!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So, if you are interested in automating those trading strategies for FREE then you probably want to check that out!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other good news, I‚Äôve been able to secure you guys a special deal on Kucoin too. Create a new Kucoin account </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/kucoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using my link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and you‚Äôll get up to </span><b>44% trading fee discount! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won‚Äôt find that deal anywhere else. So, you probably want to grab that whilst you can.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, with the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRqbPnVFeJY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deposit problems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happening at Binance currently, it might not be a bad idea to grab yourself a backup crypto exchange account either.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/kucoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign Up To Kucoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; Get Up To </span><b>44% Fee Discount!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üí∏ </span><b>Celsius:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maybe you are like me and your portfolio is currently top heavy in BTC and ETH, with a bit of stablecoin on the side? Sure you could keep all that on a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/trezor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and only have exposure to the price action. However, did you know that you could keep that price exposure to the crypto markets and earn interest on those assets whilst you wait for that price to explode?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All that is possible by lending your crypto on a platform like </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/celsius/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celsius</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All you need to do is to open an account, deposit some of that crypto and you‚Äôll start earning interest on those coins - it is that simple.</span>

<b>But are those interest rates worth it?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well, you can get over 11% on stablecoins, 4.4% of BTC, 6.35% on ETH and even up to 17% on other altcoins. So yep, that's pretty amazing when you consider the types of interest rates that you can get from your friendly local banker.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even better, if you create a Celsius account and deposit $400 or more, then you‚Äôll get </span><b>$50 FREE!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Certainly a deal worth taking advantage of.</span>

		<Title>July 25, 2021 - This REALLY Worries Me The Most!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is one risk right now that could have severe consequences for the financial markets. A risk that most people are not even paying attention to...</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am of course talking about stagflation. That unique economic ailment where you have high inflation coupled with low growth and high unemployment.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most market participants dismiss the potential for this outright. They point to strong economic growth and falling unemployment rates. They crow on about the all time highs on the stock market and record consumer spending.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, conditions appear to be changing and those that continue to dismiss it may be blindsided when it's already too late.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In my video today, I take a deeper look into the current economic climate. One with alarming rates of inflation and numerous economic headwinds. I then explain the concept of stagflation and why it could be so destructive to the world economy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I also analyse what it could mean for all markets and how I am personally positioning my portfolio to hedge against these risks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/Uc9y0Uuxg7c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìä </span><b>Portfolio Update</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üìä</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned in my video today, I have decided to take the step to diversify a bit and allocate some of the stablecoin position I have into PAXG (tokenized Gold). Holding such a large percentage of my portfolio in an asset (USDC) that was depreciating at the rate of inflation was suboptimal for me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have also decided to buy the dip on RUNE and pick up a bit more of it. I know that recent exploits have cast some doubts on the project but I am still extremely confident in it. No users lost funds and they are going to be completing audits on the protocol. Moreover, as I cover below, we are in dire need of a cross chain DEX protocol and Thorchain is one of the most promising out there.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If I have any further updates, I will let you know in my official insider </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 32.87% | BTC 29.87% | USDC 7.72% | ADA 7.48% | SOL 4.69% | DOT 3.15% | PAXG 3% | YFI 2.88% | INJ 2.30% | LINK 1.84% | ATOM 1.56% | RUNE 1.48% | LIT 0.58% | REN 0.57%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî≠ </span><b>Trends I have Noticed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî≠</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>Is This The Market Reversal?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The week started off in a really somber mood. Bitcoin had fallen below 30k as fear started to fill the air about how the Grayscale unlock would lead to a wave of selling. Well, it turns out that it was more FUD than anything and the unlock had virtually no impact. I broke it down in a bit more detail in this </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider/988"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram post.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it does finally look like we are getting some confirmation that the bull market could be back on track. I had a gut feeling that the B-Word event would be the turning point, and I was almost certain in the 24 hours before when I suddenly started to see a bunch of positive news coming out.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make no mistake though; there's no way in hell that Elon Musk has this much influence over the crypto market. As I've mentioned many times before; retail investors only make up a fraction of trading volume on any given day. I always point to that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/bitcoin-market-data-exchanges-trading"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainlysis report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which shows that over 85% of liquidity is coming from 4% of the traders (institutions &amp; whales).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What Elon says probably doesn't have a big effect on institutions, especially if they're not invested yet, but it definitely has the potential to spook weak retail hands. The same applies in reverse - the revelation that SpaceX holds Bitcoin and that Elon holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin definitely riled up retail investors which, again, can't do all that much to influence price in the grand scheme of things.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As bullish as everything is looking right now, I can't help but feel that we're not quite out of the woods yet. I'm not a fan of the fact that Bitcoin dominance is still so low, something which reflects greed as per the crypto fear and greed indicator. If you wanted to know more about this indicator, it is something I discussed </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqOqAI7OD7Y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about sentiment analysis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, a lot of money seems to be moving into Ethereum. ETH and other ETH tokens have been exploding ever since the B-Word event, especially tokens related to gaming like </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQPyDc88X8o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axie Infinity's AXS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, The Sandbox's SAND, and Decentraland's MANA. All three of these tokens look like they're in blow off top territory, but they could continue to rise against all odds along with the rest of the crypto market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What's odd is that we have yet to hear anything about those two Ethereum ETFs I discussed </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK5EN6I9xzo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about where we are in the crypto market. With EIP 1559 going live on August 4th, seeing one or even both of those ETFs get passed around that time would be more than enough for ETH to flip BTC, at least temporarily.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then again, BTC could see enough inflows from institutions to hold the throne. As revealed in Twitter's recent quarterly earnings call, CEO Jack Dorsey is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-jack-dorsey-twitter-earnings-call-q2-2021"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calling on shareholders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to greenlight the decision to invest heavily into BTC, and I reckon that's something we're likely to see. With Tesla, Twitter, and SpaceX all buying, how long before other tech giants like </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/amazon-is-hiring-a-digital-currency-and-blockchain-expert.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/apple-is-looking-for-crypto-experience-in-alternative-payments-job-post"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> join in?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>Are NFTs Coming Back?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The hottest crypto market of the year has to be what was going on in the NFT space. From under $3m in sales at the beginning of the year to over $170m during the peak back down to less than $10m during June. You can see the market </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://prnt.sc/1fcmtrf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trends here.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many were wondering that this was a passing fad. A typical cycle in the crypto space where people rush to buy the latest gimmick and flip it before it flops.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I happen to think that things are only just getting started for the sector. This is because of the massive amounts of money that is being invested in NFT infrastructure. Here is a short list of some of the recent action:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opensea </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/announcing-our-100m-raise-led-by-a16z/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raises $100m</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a 1.5bn Valuation</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dapper Labs </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/nba-top-shot-firm-dapper-labs-raising-funds-at-7-5b-valuation-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raises money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a $7.5bn Valuation</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rarible </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/nft-marketplace-startup-rarible-closes-14-2-million-series-a/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raises $14.2m</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series A</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SuperRare art market </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/nft-art-marketplace-superrare-closes-9-million-series-a/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raises $9m</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Series A</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company Called Bitski </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/bitski-raises-19-million-from-a16z-to-become-the-shopify-for-nfts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raises $19m</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a16z</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are only some of the most high profile VC raises out there. And as I have talked about on the channel before, seeing where institutional inventors are placing their bets can be a great way to determine broader trends.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not just VCs funding new marketplaces, but it is also industry titans jumping into the space. For example, just a few days ago it </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/draftkings-shares-plans-for-launch-of-nft-collectibles-marketplace/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that DraftKings plans to launch its own NFT platform. This will be aimed at curating sports and entertainment themed digital collectibles.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those that don‚Äôt know, DraftKings is the biggest Fantasy betting site in the US and they currently have over 1 million monthly active users. These users will now be able to trade NFT collectibles - more than is offered by most other marketplaces in the space.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have numerous large centralised crypto exchanges that have begun launching their own NFT marketplaces. These include the likes of </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/107087/crypto-exchange-ftx-nft-marketplace"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684901995/introducing-binance-nft-a-groundbreaking-nft-marketplace-launching-june-2021"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then of course we have all the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/polygon-launches-blockchain-gaming-and-nft-studio"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exciting stuff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is happening in the blockchain gaming space where NFT based collectible demand is going through the roof. One such game was Axie Infinity which I </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQPyDc88X8o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">covered in a video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is that there are signs that the NFT space is only just beginning.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, like anything in the crypto space, you can‚Äôt just buy any old NFT and expect it to have value in the future. Just because something is ‚Äúrare‚Äù does not make it valuable. Over 95% of all the NFTs in the space will most likely not produce a return. This is actually the case in the broader art / collectible market in general.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I can‚Äôt tell you how to invest in particular NFTs as ‚Äúvalue‚Äù is hard to judge with such unique assets. However, if there are infrastructure plays in the NFT space, then those are easier to value and their value is more closely tied to the market in general. These include any governance tokens tied to an NFT marketplace or gaming ecosystem.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope to be doing an NFT update video in the near future where I can speak about some of these in greater detail.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üõë </span><b>Regulatory Risks?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üõë</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you feeling the FOMO?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's okay, I am too. The markets are showing some positive signs of a turnaround and it's hard to ignore them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only thing that we need to worry about right now is what regulators have up their sleeves. For example, we have seen this continued crackdown on </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/binance-giant-crypto-exchange-under-regulatory-scrutiny-2021-07-01/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exchanges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/nj-regulators-give-blockfi-1-week-before-blocking-new-interest-accounts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lending platforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taking place. They are getting a lot more forceful and are targeting those services that are easy to go after (centralised platforms).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only that but it also appears as if the Defi space is feeling the heat. Fears about offering registered securities to trade is one of the reasons that Uniswap recently limited trading in certain tokens. I talked about this in greater detail in this </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider/992"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telegram post.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This move by Uniswap has me wondering whether this could be a canary in the Defi coalmine. The team is incredibly well connected (Harvard Law, Andreessen Horowitz etc). Perhaps they have gotten wind about potential regulations that could be implemented around KYC requirements for decentralised exchanges.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps this could be in relation to stablecoin regulations that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been discussed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by numerous US regulatory agencies. There must be a reason as to why Tether has voluntarily come out and stated that they </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-executives-cnbc-tech-check"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be releasing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> audited financial statements.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're wondering what you should do, that depends entirely on you. If you're comfortable with KYC, find an exchange that you trust and complete it there to save yourself the headache that's on the horizon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're a crypto believer to the core and refuse to reveal your identity, well you probably already know what options are on the table for you. I for one will be complying with regulations, but I won't be doing so silently.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span><b> Deals of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last few days have seen some nice green candles throughout crypto markets. But do you think the bottom is in? Well, if that‚Äôs the case then it might not be a bad idea to convert a bit of that dirty fiat and beef up that crypto portfolio.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe it‚Äôs also a good time to get those coins off those exchanges and hodl to new all-time-highs too?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you agree with any of that, then you‚Äôll want to check out these crypto solutions‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üí∏ </span><b>Swissborg:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Those recent fiat deposit issues on Binance have seen many people scrambling to find a new method to get in and out of crypto. Well, if you are living in Europe, UK, Canada, Singapore and Switzerland then the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/swissborg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swissborg app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is definitely an option you should look at.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, I‚Äôve been using Swissborg for some time now and, honestly, it is the easiest way I‚Äôve found to get in and out of those crypto markets. Also, when I cash out some crypto to pay for boring things like rent, I was pretty amazed to find that the fund hit my bank account in minutes!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Around</span><b> 20 different cryptos</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are available here and what‚Äôs also cool is that you can </span><b>earn yields of up to 9%</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That might be something you want to take advantage, if your plan is to hodl to the moon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if you deposit ‚Ç¨50 you‚Äôll get up to </span><b>‚Ç¨100 FREE in CHSB tokens!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What‚Äôs there not to like?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/swissborg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try Out Swissborg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; Get Up To </span><b>‚Ç¨100 FREE!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those that want a bit of a walkthrough on how to buy crypto on Swissborg, I‚Äôve done a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiw5rp3zoo0&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dedicated walkthrough</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing you exactly that! So, you might want to check that out!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîí </span><b>Trezor:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Now, I have always advocated that the safest way to store your main hodl position is by holding it in a hardware wallet. That way you don‚Äôt run the risk of an exchange being hacked and losing all your crypto.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, I use </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/trezor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as my crypto hardware wallet of choice. But I appreciate that many of you might want to weigh up your options here. So, if that is you then you‚Äôll want to check out my video on the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t3Brlb0qzQ&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top five hardware wallets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the market right now!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, with those crypto markets seeming to be heating up, now might be a good time to upgrade that crypto security.</span>

		<Title>August 1, 2021 - This is What The Fed Thinks of Crypto!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most powerful people in the world right now is the Fed chairman.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An unelected central bank governor who controls the US money supply and can impact nearly every financial market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently though, the Fed has been taking pretty strong stances on cryptocurrencies. This could either be to limit their competition to USD fiat or to limit potential competition to a Fed issued CBDC.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why it is extremely important to know where the Fed currently stands on crypto. It will help determine whether any regulations are in the pipe. Regulations that could significantly impact the future of all cryptocurrencies.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in my video today, I explore exactly what the Fed thinks of crypto. I analyse and break down all of his past statements from before he was chairman to current day.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I also give my own view on what these imply as well as what regulations we could one day see. Perhaps the chances of a Fed Issued US dollar are higher than we think‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All covered in my video </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/VZI-o3bCsMw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìä</span><b> Portfolio Update </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìä</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Only minor changes to the portfolio this week. Took a little bit of profit on some ETH and bought some more SOL with it. My rationale is just to diversify some of ETH exposure to other smart contract chains. Moreover, I still remain extremely bullish on the potential of SOL in the medium to long term.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of any additions, there are a few other tokens that I am thinking of adding. I am currently doing research on some of these for an upcoming video. I will keep you guys updated on those projects in my official </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC 31.07% | ETH 30.79% | ADA 6.89% | USDC 6.70% | SOL 6.43% | DOT 3.30% | YFI 2.78% | PAXG 2.63% | RUNE 2.32% | INJ 2.29% | LINK 2.06% | ATOM 1.53% | REN 0.65% | LIT 0.57%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Market Trends</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üìà</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This has been the strongest week in the crypto market that I can remember, and not just because prices went up. It‚Äôs one of the few times that Bitcoin dominance rose while all crypto prices were also rising. What this shows me is that this rally isn't being driven by retail greed - it's institutions getting back on board.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary driver of this week's strong rally seems to be the crackdown on centralised exchanges. I know that sounds crazy, but it's what the on chain indicators suggest. For example, this week we had the news that Binance would be </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/9df8225c061b455da5c7cc293cd08a70"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limiting daily withdrawals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on non-KYC accounts to 0.06 BTC. The moment that this happened, the amount of BTC on exchanges skydived, and the amount of BTC held by whales spiked along with it. It's not only Binance; we have also seen other exchanges like </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bybit-will-require-facial-recognition"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bybit et al</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bringing in mandatory KYC requirements.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I suspect that there are quite a few wealthy crypto investors that are operating outside of the system, and now they're forced to sit on their BTC and alts until they can find a way to cash out without revealing their identity. I'm a bit torn about this KYC requirement. It seemed inevitable and it means less privacy but at least it helped to lift the crypto markets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I think that regulators are looking to get a lot more active in their crypto lawmaking quest. There are a few bills and amendments floating around in the United States wanting to do crazy things like have the Federal Reserve control stablecoins or </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://decrypt.co/77326/not-a-drill-infrastructure-bill-could-sink-american-crypto-industry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">radically increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the taxes on crypto gains.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have the likes of Elizabeth Warren who seems to be </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1420422848884133889?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on a crusade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to limit the one technology that can actually help marginalised communities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm not sure if any of these will pass or whether Warren will get her wish. This is because crypto does have allies in congress including </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/CynthiaMLummis/status/1420138802224447492?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cynthia Lummis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as its own </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/113052/crypto-lobby-infrastructure-bill-washington"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lobby group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Moreover, the news isn't deterring big investors, so I'll take it as a sign that these aren't as big of a threat as they've been made out to be.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, a worldwide crypto crackdown could be coming later this year. This is as per the Financial Action Task Force's recommendations that have been made over the past few months. It could have some serious implications, and I'll be doing an in depth video about that later this week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of later this week, there is something else happening which I have been looking forward to for over a year‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>Wednesday‚Äôs The Day</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs been a long time coming but the Ethereum London Hard Fork is upon us. On the 4th of August, it will officially be rolled out with one of the most anticipated improvement proposals yet - EIP 1559.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is something that I have been talking about for over a year but it is great to see that it‚Äôs about to become a reality. As we know, EIP 1559 will see a base fee burn implemented which will significantly reduce the amount of ETH inflation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to tell exactly how much the burn will impact on supply. According to Tim Beiko, a core Ethereum Dev, it could be anywhere </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://unchainedpodcast.com/ethereums-eip-1559-will-solve-some-problems-but-big-ones-will-remain/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">between 25% - 75%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the fee. This also depends on how much gas users are willing to pay on top of the base fee to get urgent transactions through.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I covered in my most recent </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/lANUSdHg2oc?t=969"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video on Ethereum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, based on past averages, the base fee burn is likely to crimp ETH inflation down from approximately 4.4% to about 1.7%. This is coincidentally about the same inflation rate on Bitcoin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite how important EIP 1559 is for the Ethereum ecosystem, it still pales into comparison with what else is currently being built. We cannot forget that ETH 2.0 is being worked on in the background and we are likely to see a move to Proof-of-Stake earlier than you think.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the ETH 2.0 roadmap, the PoS merge is still estimated to take place this year. Moreover, we have recently had a pull request for EIP-3675 being published in Ethereum‚Äôs GitHub. This is the ‚Äúmerge‚Äù pull request that will see Proof of Stake become a reality on the network.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from these upcoming improvements and upgrades, the Ethereum network is as active and bullish as ever. A few weeks ago, Ethereum had </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-s-active-addresses-fall-below-ethereum-s-after-60-drop-in-six-weeks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more active addresses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than Bitcoin which only shows the massive demand there is to use the network.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand to hold ETH is increasing as well. Not only do we see the amount of ETH in the staking contract </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://duneanalytics.com/hagaetc/eth2-0-deposits"><span style="font-weight: 400;">breaking record highs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but we have also seen whale addresses </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1418210440262287363"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accumulating ETH</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a rapid clip.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of this, you also have increasing institutional interest in ETH over the past few months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you have the folks over at Goldman Sachs who think that it‚Äôs possible </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ether-bitcoin-price-outlook-store-of-value-ethereum-goldman-sachs-2021-7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You have JP Morgan claiming that ETH 2.0 could </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2021/07/01/jpmorgan-says-ethereum-upgrades-could-jumpstart-40-billion-staking-industry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jump start</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $40bn staking industry. Fidelity is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/16/fidelity-ether-trading-crypto-ethereum-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beginning to offer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ETH trading for their clients in 2022.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, while the 4th of August is an important milestone in Etheruem‚Äôs journey, it‚Äôs still a small stepping stone in the mountain we are climbing. I am glad that I have been accumulating over the past few weeks and this is the reason that ETH is currently one of my largest holdings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Newbie Tips</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üîù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I said it before and I'll say it again - you can't rely on a single exchange to do all of your trading. You need to have multiple altcoin exchanges as well as numerous fiat-crypto payment gateway accounts. There are many participants that are trying to make it harder for us to use these exchanges (banks and regulators).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the exchanges themselves are seeing the ground shifting and are limiting user access in anticipation of potential regulation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, on top of that move by Binance on non-KYC‚Äôed accounts, they have also been restricting more users from particular geos. They are </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-exchange-binance-wind-down-futures-derivatives-offerings-europe-2021-07-30/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limiting futures trading</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">support in Europe and have been ordered to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/binance-malaysia-operations-illegal-futures-derivatives-germany-italy-netherlands-2021-7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limit access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to users in Malaysia. Obviously there are ways around this, but based on all the articles I'm seeing in the crypto media about that, it's probably a matter of time before a lot of these services are KYC only.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were (or will be) affected by rules like these, this is the perfect time to take full custody of your funds. Get yourself a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t3Brlb0qzQ&amp;pp=sAQA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hardware wallet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and store your coins securely. Nobody can restrict where you choose to send them or what you choose to do with it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, now is a great time to learn about decentralized finance and familiarise yourself with all the different protocols and how to use them. Swapping, lending, borrowing, cross-chain, the whole shebang.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes a bit of cash and a bit of practice, but I've got loads of tutorials to help you how to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfkqgXNPiHg&amp;pp=sAQA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set up a Metamask</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, how to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rEqGX4eRnk&amp;pp=sAQA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">connect to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Binance Smart Chain, and also the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJd_3q4Tag0&amp;pp=sAQA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polygon Ethereum side chain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All of these tools will allow you to take full control of your crypto and use it as intended.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I will be exploring many more DeFi topics and tutorials in the coming weeks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those crypto markets have been on a tear this week. But are you satisfied to just hodl your current crypto stack to new all-time-highs? Or are you looking to build that portfolio up whilst you can? If you take this second view then there are three core ways to make that happen:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying more crypto with fiat</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trading</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earning crypto interest</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If any of that interests you, then you‚Äôll want to know about these two crypto solutions‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>3Commas:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Now, those crypto markets are currently swinging wildly at all hours of a day. That means there are plenty of trading opportunities for those with the skills to take advantage of that. However, there are two major obstacles:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">1) Many crypto traders have no idea if the strategy they are using is a winning one or not. But here‚Äôs the thing, you can </span><b>stack the deck in your favour</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by </span><b>backtesting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your trading strategy against historical price data. By doing that, you‚Äôll know if your strategy would have turned a profit in the past - a useful indication to help you gauge if that strategy is worth pursuing today.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2) Oftentimes, the most profitable opportunities to trade take place when you are asleep. However, when you </span><b>automate your trading strategy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can execute these buy &amp; sell orders 24/7/365</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If any of those problems seem familiar, then you are going to want to take a look at </span><b>crypto trading bots</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I‚Äôve done a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye3nUsbegGI&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dedicated video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> telling you everything you need to know about that!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you haven‚Äôt got 25 minutes to spare, I will save you the time and let you know that the crypto trading bot I personally use is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/3commas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3Commas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It allows you to test out your trading strategy and automate those trades!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But no one wants to pay for something without trying it out.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üíµ </span><b>Swissborg:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Want to know the easiest way I‚Äôve found to buy crypto with fiat as well as earning crypto interest? Well, that would be the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/swissborg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swissborg app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it‚Äôs the option for you if you are looking for an easy way to buy Bitcoin and altcoins with GBP, CAD, EUR, ZAR, DKK, SGD, SEK, CHF, NOK, PLN, RON, HUF, HKD, CZK or ILS.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, that is pretty extensive fiat currency support. Even better, you can </span><b>earn up to 9.7% interest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on stablecoins and up to 5.25% on cryptos like ETH. That‚Äôs not too shabby when you probably would have just sat on that crypto and earnt nothing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if you deposit ‚Ç¨50 you‚Äôll get up to</span><b> ‚Ç¨100 FREE in CHSB tokens!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So, you can collect that value whilst trying Swissborg for yourself.</span>

		<Title>August 8, 2021 - You Are Being RIPPED OFF!! Here‚Äôs How</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week we saw one of the most controversial IPOs of this year. I am of course talking about that of Robinhood, the ‚ÄúFree‚Äù trading app that has taken the market by storm.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs perhaps also one of the most vilified brokers out there on account of the shenanigans that they were involved in with trade stoppages at the beginning of the year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, despite how egregious these were, I think they pale into comparison when you look at Robinhood‚Äôs underlying business model. This broker is robbing from the common man and giving to the rich hedge funders - the anti Robin Hood.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not just a practice that is exclusive to Robinhood. Nearly all of the free brokers on Wall Street use the same business practices. Business practices that are used by sophisticated market makers to get an edge on the rest of us.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I thought it was high time that I did a video that exposed these business practices and explained exactly how they work against you. I also have a few thoughts on whether we could see additional regulation on these practices and why I think that the opaqueness of these business practices are long term bullish for crypto &amp; Defi.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/oCQou6xuXbk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìä </span><b>Portfolio Update</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üìä</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Took a bit of profit on some of my alt positions in the recent rally. This includes YFI, LINK, REN &amp; LIT. Going to be holding the proceeds from this sale in a 50/50 split between USDC &amp; PAXG. The reasoning for allocation to the latter is given </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc9y0Uuxg7c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I did two weeks ago.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There were no new purchases this week although I am considering picking up either MATIC, AAVE or LUNA. I will be letting you guys know all about that in an upcoming video on top coin picks later this week. Jump into my insider </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telegram channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for up to date info on that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 33.96% | BTC 29.26% | ADA 6.77% | SOL 6.27% | USDC 5.85% | PAXG 4.33% | DOT 3.60% | INJ 2.56% | RUNE 2.28% | YFI 1.72% | ATOM 1.43% | LINK 1.42% | REN 0.30% | LIT 0.27%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ùì </span><b>Reddit AMA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚ùì</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you guys know that one of the fastest growing subreddits on Reddit is the r/cryptocurrency one? I mean, it's not entirely unexpected given how much interest there has been in this space. I am also a regular visitor of that subreddit. It‚Äôs a great way for me to get a sense of sentiment from the rest of the community.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I thought that it was only fitting that I engaged with the community there. As such, I will be doing a </span><b>two hour AMA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the </span><b>cryptocurrency subreddit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this coming week!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üóìÔ∏è </span><b>Date:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> August 12th</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚è∞ </span><b>Time:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 4PM UK time (11AM EST)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìç </span><b>Place:</b> <a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">r/cryptocurrency</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So I hope you pop that in your calendar and think up some interesting questions in the meantime. The AMA will be pinned at the top of the sub Reddit two hours before the AMA - so keep an eye out for that!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I look forward to seeing you there and answering as many questions as possible.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üóû </span><b>This Horrible Bill </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üóû</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who have been following me for the past 2 months, you will have seen me warn about potential incoming regulation and enforcement. However, never did I think that we would see such egregious overreach as has been presented in this </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/senates-infrastructure-bill-what-to-expect-on-saturday"><span style="font-weight: 400;">infrastructure bill.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just so you understand the lay of the land, a seemingly innocuous infrastructure bill has been weaponised to attack the crypto industry. Deliberately vague wording has been inserted as an amendment that could be interpreted very broadly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendment would require all crypto ‚Äúbrokers‚Äù to submit tax information on those people that are using them to trade crypto. However, given how broadly brokers are defined, this could also have meant nodes, miners and defi developers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After finding out about this, I was shocked. How can laws be made like this on a whim? Then after a bit of research into the US legislative process, I learned that it is a pretty common tactic. For example, part of the reason that the US has such a big surveillance state right now is due to all the overzealous amendments to the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#Controversy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patriot Act.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, when it came to this </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the person behind the lobbying to include it was (surprise, surprise), Janet Yellen. If you recall in </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZI-o3bCsMw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I did last week on the Fed, she was looking for ways to choke the crypto industry. So she used this bill as a reason to.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the bill has gone through a number of iterations. Long story short, the amendment in its current form </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has included</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> both Proof of Work miners and Proof of Stake validators as being exempt. However, it says nothing about all the other consensus mechanisms out there. Moreover, it has no wording in there to protect Defi developers from the reporting standard.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in its current form, this is what the amendment means:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who builds a Defi dapp or other protocol that facilitates an exchange (think DEX) could be viewed as a ‚Äúbroker‚Äù in this law. They would need to submit tax info on their users (which they obviously can‚Äôt do).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, it means that any validator on a consensus mechanism that is not PoS or PoW will fall into the same ‚Äúbroker‚Äù category. There are numerous other consensus mechanisms! And what about those that don‚Äôt exist yet? Will they still innovate?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a terrible amendment to an already bloated and overreaching bill. It‚Äôs unconscionable to me that such far reaching regulation can be made on the fly with a bit of wording in an amendment. No debates. No discussion. No collaboration.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The final vote could extend to Tuesday and I will of course keep you guys updated in my </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Irrespective of what happens with this vote, the whole process has me even more bullish. Here is why:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It shows me that they view crypto as such a threat that they have to resort to these tactics.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have witnessed the power of the crypto community in response to it. There are pro crypto </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/SenLummis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">senators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fighting for us and there is a strong crypto lobbying body</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It shows the importance of decentralised governance and DAOs. Centralised, opaque and rushed methods of rule making are the antithesis of crypto defi governance. If only there was a congress DAO?</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, despite the buzz around the bill, I am still hopeful for the future. Moreover, the world is global. Crypto innovation can happen anywhere. It would just be a pity if US lawmakers stifled that in the US.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Feel The Burn</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum London upgrade took place this week, and it went off without a hitch. At block 12,965,000, the fork took place and with it came EIP 1559.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I must admit, I was actually quite apprehensive prior to the upgrade and decided to get out of the office and </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1423205006317076480?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grab some fresh air</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the actual time it went live.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it‚Äôs amazing how smoothly the upgrade went. Transactions kept processing, blocks kept propagating and miners kept hashing. From the first block, the base fee burn mechanism started working its magic. As of this moment, we have burned around 13.5k ETH and the amount burned is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-burns-5000-coins-in-2-days"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 36%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all that has been issued.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in other words, the ETH inflation rate has fallen by about 36%. If we were to assume a pre upgrade inflation rate of c. 4.2%, it has dropped to about 3.0%. It‚Äôs not deflationary or ‚Äúultra sound money‚Äù yet but that is mainly because we are still on ETH 1.0.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And that‚Äôs what makes me so bullish. It‚Äôs what this means for the 2.0 upgrades. What this has shown me is just how well the actual hardfork went. For example, it was the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1423677403721764870"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that all blocks were mined on the upgraded chain. Moreover, the testnet simulations of block capacity were </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1423568180572684288"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amazingly accurate.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While the runup prior to the fork may have been a ‚Äúbuy the news‚Äù rally, the event did not lead to a dump. Market participants saw how well it was handled and immediately turned their attention to the PoS merge that will be happening either later this year or early next.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Ethereum reaches the level of scaling that is envisioned by ETH 2.0, there is a possibility that the burn rate could exceed the block reward (i.e. deflationary).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to fees, some users may have been disappointed to see that there wasn‚Äôt a massive drop post fork. However, it was always known that the impact on user fees would be more around gas predictability.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That is another reason why everyone is so excited about ETH 2.0. The PoS consensus will increase scalability and hence reduce the fees.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I‚Äôm damn excited for what could happen with ETH in the next year and I will be doing a post London video for you folks in the next few weeks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Newbie Tips </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you panic sold in the past few weeks, I can understand how you feel. As </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/panic-selling-is-crypto-investors-biggest-mistake-new-survey-reveals"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported by CoinTelegraph</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, panic selling is one of the biggest mistakes you can make in crypto and it's one that we've all made at some point or another (including me).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The way I personally protect myself from this is to make sure I always take profits on the way up and re-invest gradually on the way down. It does minimise my returns compared to if I had sold the top and bought the dip, but doing this consistently is damn near impossible to do. There are so many idiosyncratic factors impacting not just crypto but the broader financial markets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it does help to be able to at least sense where we are in the crypto market and I have videos about how to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5MCQJR-yWA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spot the top</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and how to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prkv45GfGUg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy the dip</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the channel.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On a related note, the only thing worse than panic selling is selling too early. This is going to be very tempting to do in the weeks ahead especially if your portfolio is currently in the red. If you don't plan on selling at the break even point, there are many other people who are likely planning to do this.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What that means is that your favorite cryptos could see significant resistance at or around the significant price points where most people previously bought (at the top, for example). This means that you'll need to be a bit patient if you're trying to turn a profit over the next few weeks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing I've noticed recently is that people are starting to make insane predictions about what's going to happen next in the crypto market. While I personally do think we will be heading higher before the year is over, the idea that crypto will go up only from here on out is a bit of a pipe dream.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the fact that nothing can go up forever, continuing to go up into 2022 would violate just about every asset pricing model. Not only that, but there is a well established 4 year cycle of crypto prices. And, while history never fully repeats itself, it usually rhymes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm extremely happy that the markets are on the uptrend again. But, it‚Äôs very important to manage your expectations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So much of this comes down to being aware that a cryptocurrency's market cap is the best measure of how high it could go, not its price. Always factor this into your calculation when making predictions about cryptocurrency prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs face it, those crypto markets seem to be cranking up the heat - in a good way! With that sort of action going on, now has never been a better time to keep on top of your portfolio and to ensure your crypto is safe!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If that sounds like something you should be taking more seriously, then I have two crypto tools you‚Äôll want to look at!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîí </span><b>Trezor:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The worst nightmare for any crypto holder is picking the right crypto, see it hitting life changing value and then discovering that your crypto has been stolen. If that‚Äôs a nightmare you want to avoid then, you‚Äôll want to consider getting yourself the best crypto security that money can buy - in other words, a crypto hardware wallet!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, I have already done a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t3Brlb0qzQ&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dedicated video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comparing the top hardware wallets on the market right now.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you don‚Äôt have 24 minutes to spend on watching that, then you‚Äôll probably be wondering which hardware wallet I personally use? Well, that would be </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/trezor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor!</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These wallets can store over 1,000 cryptos. So, the chances are that almost everything in your portfolio will be supported by this wallet.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, you can get the slightly more pricey Trezor Model T, but I myself prefer to buy more than one Trezor One and spread that risk. This is something you may also want to consider if you have sizable amounts of crypto stored.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/trezor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Your Trezor Now!</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ü§ñ </span><b>Portfolio Automation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that crypto is popping off, many of you are probably wanting to dollar cost average into the markets or maybe the market surge has meant your portfolio is overweight in one particular holding? Yes, you can do all that manually, but it is a chore!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you value your time then you might want to look for a tool that will automate all that for you? If that‚Äôs you then you‚Äôll want to take a look at </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/shrimpy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shrimply!</span></a>

		<Title>August 15, 2021 - Thinking of ETH?? Watch This!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been so much going on in the crypto space over the past 2 weeks that it can sometimes be hard to keep track of everything.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime example: Ethereum just went through one of its most consequential upgrades ever. That was the London upgrade and since then ETH has been on a monumental rally.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, is this likely to continue?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that‚Äôs exactly what I am going to explore in my video today. It‚Äôs my much needed update on Ethereum where I will dive into some of the most important stats and metrics to watch post hardfork. I will be analysing burn &amp; emission rates, onchain stats and ETH 2.0 projections.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I will also be taking a look at some of the more favourable market developments that have been present even before the upgrade. These include more institutional adoption and trading volume as well as bullish ETH options markets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you hold ETH or are considering it for your portfolio - this video is for you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch it </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/NNa7bWQsC4M"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìä </span><b>Portfolio Update</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üìä</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned last week, I was considering adding some more tokens to my portfolio. One of those was MATIC. And, if you watched </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK3PAEAfIfE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on my top altcoin picks this week, you will have seen that I decided to pick it up. This was done with some of that outstanding USDC.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, there were no other changes to the portfolio this week. I am pretty happy with the top level allocation to some of my largest holdings. Of course, I am constantly on the lookout for attractive entry opportunities in numerous coins / tokens - all of which I cover in my </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 32.76% | BTC 28.28% | ADA 9.21% | SOL 6.59% | PAXG 3.99% | USDC 3.89% | DOT 3.64% | INJ 2.50% | RUNE 2.24% | YFI 1.88% | MATIC 1.51% | LINK 1.45% | ATOM 1.44% | REN 0.31% | LIT 0.30%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We seem to be approaching the final few phases of this bull market, and there are a few reasons why.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum had it's historic upgrade last week, Cardano's smart contract hard fork is confirmed for September 12/13, and Polkadot's Parachain slot auctions should be happening any day now.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It also looks like Bitcoin will be getting an ETF, though it won't be the crypto backed ETF everyone was hoping for...</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That's because SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said he's open to approving Bitcoin ETFs but only those backed by Bitcoin futures. I covered this in </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/uPBR3mn6wKU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video yesterday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the SEC‚Äôs crypto view.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were around back during the last bull run, you'll remember that the launch of the CME Bitcoin Futures actually marked the market top, at least for Bitcoin. One has to wonder if a Bitcoin ETF of some sort could mark the cap of our current bull cycle. The more ETFs that start buying up futures to create synthetic exposure to Bitcoin, the more precarious the market conditions become.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you watched my video </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3-j0JTTJYE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about crypto ETFs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you'll know that the SEC has 45 days to confirm or reject an ETF application. Given that a bunch of Bitcoin futures backed ETFs were filed last week, this means we could see an approval in the coming weeks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This could also coincide with El Salvador‚Äôs official launch of Bitcoin as a legal tender in the country which is due to take place on the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bitcoin-become-legal-tender-el-salvador-sept-7-2021-06-25/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7th of September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And let‚Äôs not forget about any potential amendments to that controversial crypto provision in the infrastructure bill (more on that below).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, what‚Äôs even more exciting is what is happening on the altcoin front in September - and it‚Äôs here where things get interesting...</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the last bull market, Litecoin was the first crypto to skyrocket before the rest of the market joined in. There are a lot of traders who think we're going to see something similar this time around, with an altcoin of some kind leading the charge for the final phase of the bull market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If this scenario does in fact play out again, Cardano seems to be the crypto that's leading the charge this time around. If we see ADA break past it's all time high in the next week or two, we could see the rest of the large altcoins follow suit, including Bitcoin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, you could argue that what's leading the charge this time is the NFT market. There are literally photos of low resolution rocks </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/investors-are-shelling-out-six-figures-for-pet-rock-nfts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">selling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Also, I was seeing </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/BobLoukas/status/1424811506206707716?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rumours on Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it was costing people thousands of dollars to buy NFT mints (and that‚Äôs just the gas fees!).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the crypto market, there isn't very much liquidity in the NFT market, and as much as different users are tracking the ceilings and floors for different NFTs, those don't really exist as much as you think they do.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the NFT hype starts to wane, I think that crypto will find its way into altcoins and Bitcoin, and maybe that momentum shift has already begun. Oh and if you're curious what owning an NFT actually means, you can watch my recent video </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv_fi4AGuf4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about NFTs here.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üóû </span><b>Latest From Capitol Hill </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üóû</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For someone who rarely follows politics, the recent showdown on Capitol Hill over that infrastructure bill was one of the most exciting things that has happened this year. As I mentioned last week, I was initially quite disheartened by the fact that lawmakers could so arbitrarily make such far-reaching legislation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this week filled me with a lot more optimism. To me, it truly illustrated just how far we have come in the crypto space. Politicians were hoping for a speedy vote to an amendment that they thought was uncontroversial.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, they quickly learned just how misguided that was. Not only did they face the full brunt of the crypto lobbying industry, but they also fielded thousands of calls from the crypto community. A community that is perhaps the most passionate that there is.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These efforts were so impactful that Portman, Warner &amp; Sinema came together with Lummis &amp; Toomey to work </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1031"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on a compromise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A compromise that sufficiently tightened the definition of a broker to exclude validators and miners as well as exempting those developers from any action.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, given that it was a bi-partisan amendment, it would have passed had it not been for a single Senator...</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs right, 87 year old Richard Shelby voted against the amendment which of course scuppered it. He claimed that he supported the amendment but voted it down because he needed more defense spending. The crypto community didn‚Äôt buy it and you can see just how passionate they are in their responses to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/SenShelby/status/1425142857199980550"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his Tweet.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, it seems as if the crypto defenders on the Hill are gearing up for a bigger battle in the House. There are already a number of pro-crypto congressmen that are looking to narrow the wording of the provision and give protections to developers and validators. These efforts have clearly been laid out in </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/13/crypto-house-democrats-tax-fight-504341"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Politico.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there are still many challenges for any sort of amendment. If there are specific changes to the crypto provision then there is the possibility that it will have to go back to the senate and put the entire bill itself into question.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, they are trying and we should not underestimate the power that the crypto community and industry can wield. Indeed, the blowback was so intense that the treasury has come out and tried to assuage fears. They have claimed that they will only be seeking tax data from those firms that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-13/treasury-seeks-to-quell-fears-crypto-tax-rules-are-overly-broad"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they consider brokers.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, that would require us to trust Yellen‚Äôs treasury department - a dubious proposal at best.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Irrespective of what happens in the house, it‚Äôs still remarkable where we are. If you had told me just a year ago that we would have intense conversation in the US congress about different DLT consensus mechanisms, I would have called you crazy. But crazy it is and here we are.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto is here to stay and everyone knows it. They can try to make our lives difficult with burdensome regulation but every action has an equal and opposite reaction. And now that we have shown our collective bargaining power, we know how we can effectively use it going forward.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Newbie Tips </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If I'm correct that we're in the final phases of the bull market, this means we're about to see some extreme price volatility. A big part of that is coming from the fact that the balance of cryptocurrency on exchanges, namely BTC and ETH, continues to fall. When there's a shortage of supply, volatility tends to spike.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, I would not advise trading under these conditions, nor would I even pay much attention to the day to day moves, and certainly not anything happening on the hourly. It will do a number on your mental health (believe me). The solution then? Zoom out. Focus on the weekly. Keep your cool. Watch those big moving averages.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further to the first point, volatility means that crypto exchanges are put under pressure. Earlier this week, Binance suddenly went down for "maintenance" as is often the case when the market gets hot. A few of my mates didn't have the best of times with that to say the least, and it's not an issue that's unique to Binance. We see Coinbase going through this constantly!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Exchanges have a habit of going down, or suddenly asking you for KYC, or not being able to withdraw, etc. etc. These are just a few of the top tips I discussed in my video about how to prepare for the bull market. I strongly recommend you </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqHfTITx4yQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">give that a watch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASAP.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing to keep in mind is how much regulators are closing in on the crypto sector. I've heard and seen a lot of chatter about keeping your crypto gains in stablecoins in an attempt to avoid tax, or even just to sit on during the bear market. I </span><b>do not</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommend this whatsoever.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, because you should not be evading tax and secondly because you could get caught. Stablecoins are front and center for regulators like the SEC and </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZyTDJPnp14&amp;t=1s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the FATF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and especially now that Circle has announced plans to become a fully regulated digital bank. It is not inconceivable that KYC could be coming to anyone who's holding USDC in their personal wallet.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These centralized stablecoin issuers have previously frozen user accounts on behalf of authorities, and the last thing you want is to get caught with your pants down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, if we see new all-time highs in the coming weeks, your family and friends will probably come to you again asking for advice about what to buy, when to sell, or even just how to make back their losses. I know it's tempting to help those that you care about, but you have to be clear that you're not giving them any financial advice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You might be able to handle the volatility, but retail investors definitely can't. If having them constantly come to you every time the price changes isn't stressful enough, just wait if they fail to sell before the price starts to fall. You won't want to be on the other end of that conversation, believe me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I imagine most of you are pretty excited about the recent price action of those crypto markets. However, those that are serious about crypto are probably plotting how they can take advantage of these markets for maximum gains.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If that‚Äôs you, then I have two crypto platforms you should know about!</span>

<b>Best US Exchange:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It‚Äôs no secret that crypto regulations in the US are some of the strictest in the world. That‚Äôs made things a little tricky for those looking for a top-notch regulated US crypto exchange.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If that‚Äôs a problem you have been struggling with then you‚Äôll definitely want to check out </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/ftx-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX US</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here you‚Äôll get access to a solid selection of cryptos, the ability to deposit via bank and be able to enjoy super competitive fees.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh yes, it turns out that legendary quarterback, Tom Brady, is a shareholder in FTX US. If you want to learn more about that, then I recommend you watch my </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFTZFdgJrjg&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dedicated video review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on this exchange!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The great news about FTX US is that I‚Äôve also been able to secure you an exclusive deal too.

		<Title>August 22, 2021 - Have You SEEN THIS?? Institutional Crypto Report!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes crypto reports come in under the radar and never seem to gain that much traction (despite how insightful it may be).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One such report is the H1 Coinbase institutional report.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In it they give an in-depth look at how the institutional landscape is shaping up. As a company that is at the coal face of institutional demand, their research and opinions matter. It helps us to determine which way the wind blows for the coming 6 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs a pretty long report, so I have decided to distill it into an easy to digest video!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video, I go through some of the most important data in the report and analyse their findings. I also give some of my own commentary and analysis about what this could mean for the crypto markets going forward.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, I do have some of my own predictions about what we could be seeing in the coming months. You guys can watch that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/OhOAzB3Afmc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìä </span><b>Portfolio Update </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìä</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Took a bit of profit in some of the alts that have been performing well recently. This includes the likes of REN &amp; ADA. The proceeds from this sale are being kept 50/50 in PAXG &amp; USDC as dry powder as I scout for additional opportunities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few gems that are on my radar which I plan to be covering in the next few weeks. I will keep you guys updated in my only official </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telegram channel.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 29.32% | BTC 26.58% | SOL 10.21% | ADA 8.85% | PAXG 4.28% | USDC 4.17% | DOT 4.01% | INJ 3.05% | RUNE 2.76% | ATOM 1.90% | YFI 1.70% | MATIC 1.53% | LINK 1.35% | LIT 0.29%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The big money is back in town. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies has pushed past </span><b>2 TRILLION dollars</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is a huge milestone to reclaim and it will be even bigger once we start seeing new all time highs across the board.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We've already seen a few first movers in this regard: Cardano, Solana, and Terra are just a few examples. It just so happens that these were 3 of my 5 top altcoin picks for the rest of the year, and you can learn about the other two by </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK3PAEAfIfE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watching that video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you haven't already.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of Solana, you've probably noticed that a lot of cryptos in Solana's ecosystem have been rallying in conjunction with SOL. One of these is Audius which I covered last week, and another one is a cryptocurrency called Arweave.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Arweave is a decentralized storage solution similar to Filecoin, and it's actually where Solana stores all of its blockchain data as well as all of those Degen Ape NFTs that people were buying last week. The AR coin has consequently exploded, and I know it's only a matter of time before you guys start asking about it. So I've decided to get ahead of the curve by making a video about it this week. Be sure to stay tuned for that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you've been watching the charts for Bitcoin, you've probably noticed that we are quickly approaching a golden cross (when the 50 day MA crosses the 200 day MA from below). This is almost always a signal that a market is headed for new all time highs, so if we hit that threshold we're going to see a lot of activity across the board. However, I have a feeling this golden cross is going to be a bit of a contrarian indicator and here are a few reasons why.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, regulators are closing in on crypto. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler was </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401"><span style="font-weight: 400;">very vocal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week about cracking down on DeFi and it's possible that stablecoins could be a part of that mix. If you </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPBR3mn6wKU&amp;t=170s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watched my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about this, you'll recall that the SEC is asking politicians for more power to police cryptocurrencies.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially the soonest this could have happened was late September when US politicians all return from recess, but it looks like they will be assembling this week to try and rush through those two multi-trillion dollar spending packages - one of which is of course the controversial infrastructure bill.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To quickly recap, the infrastructure bill contains a tax provision that requires cryptocurrency "brokers" to collect KYC for their users for tax purposes. The problem is that this definition is so broad that it could apply to almost anyone in cryptocurrency, including miners, developers, and possibly even certain users. Regulators have </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-13/treasury-seeks-to-quell-fears-crypto-tax-rules-are-overly-broad"><span style="font-weight: 400;">come out and said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that miners and developers will not fall under this umbrella, but I'm not one to take a politician's word on anything.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, the worst case scenario of a crypto crackdown is unlikely to happen this week even if the infrastructure bill is passed. This is because we will still have to wait 10 days for the US president to sign it before it becomes law. There's even a possibility that the voting could be delayed until the politicians return from their summer recess.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, remember to factor in the macro going on in the background. And I'll be doing a video this week about all the different bullish and bearish developments that are planned to happen (or could possibly happen) in the coming months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üåé </span><b>Adoption on the Rise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üåé</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been so much going on in the crypto space over the past few weeks that we can sometimes lose sight of the forest for the trees.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this week I was able to take a step back and see the bigger picture once again. That was thanks to the release of a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report by Chainalysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that looked at broader global crypto adoption.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a really fascinating report that used an index to analyse the growth of crypto adoption in a number of countries around the world. Based on this index, global adoption has grown by over 2,300% since Q3 of 2019.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This grassroots crypto adoption has also coincided with an explosion of trading volume on P2P marketplaces. Some of the countries with the most growth in usage of these platforms include Kenya, Vietnam, Nigeria and Venezuela. What‚Äôs even more surprising than this is the fact that we saw declines in these volumes in countries such as China &amp; the USA.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons as to why these countries saw so much adoption in crypto but they are all tied to the benefits of its use as a medium of exchange. In Vietnam, it‚Äôs down to remittance flows (cheaper to send Bitcoin), in </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/nigeria-40-million-bitcoin-trading-p2p"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria and Kenya</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it‚Äôs down to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/31/out-of-control-and-rising-why-bitcoin-has-nigerias-government-in-a-panic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buying imports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Venezuela, crypto is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/venezuelas-economy-regresses-crypto-fills-gaps-2021-06-22/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helping people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> survive in a hyperinflationary environment.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And I happen to think that adoption is only going to be increasing thanks to more acceptance by governments in the emerging world. For example, we all know that El Salvador is about to make Bitcoin a legal tender. On the 6th of September, it will be the first country in the world that will be making such a move.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The choice of whether to use Bitcoin in the country will </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-not-mandatory-businesses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">be optional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so it will be interesting to see how many people actually start transacting with it. Could it go the same way as countries like Nigeria or Vietnam where people embrace it with open arms? Or will it be a damp squib that was nothing more than a PR stunt.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It won‚Äôt only be our eyes focused on this rollout. There are also a number of other South American countries that are monitoring the impacts of this.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of these is Argentina whose president </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cryptobriefing.com/argentina-may-adopt-bitcoin-to-curb-inflation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was recently asked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about crypto. He acknowledged that its rise was inevitable and that it had the broader potential to ‚Äúnullify inflation‚Äù. Quite telling from a president of a country that is seeing inflation of </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-inflation-seen-year-low-32-june-likely-reheat-2nd-half-2021-07-15/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 50%.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, while cryptocurrency does have regulatory headwinds in countries like the US &amp; China, the rest of the world is picking up the slack. Moreover, this is the fundamental adoption that cannot be stopped. It is something that I covered </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGs9ZATMnCw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a few months ago on India &amp; Nigeria‚Äôs crypto bans - both countries that have continued adoption unabated.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest in cryptocurrency will wane when prices stagnate. The amount of people investing in a bear market will be a fraction of what it is now. However, if you are using crypto in your daily life, the markets are of lesser importance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By weaving cryptocurrency into the fabric of their monetary systems, these countries are making it a lot harder for governments to rugpull us with regulations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù</span><b> Top Newbie Tips </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We seem to be entering the most difficult phase of this bull market. I know this sounds strange; prices are going up, what's so difficult about that? Well, have you taken the time to plan your exit strategy? More importantly, do you have the mental fortitude to stick to your exit strategy even if you sell and prices keep going up?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where most traders fail...</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this in mind, it is absolutely crucial that you craft your exit strategy if you haven't already. You're going to have to do this for every altcoin you hold, and that's the difficult part. Each altcoin has its own unique updates going on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For Bitcoin it's the possibility of an ETF. For Ethereum it's the upcoming move to Proof of Stake. For Cardano it's the introduction of smart contracts. For Polkadot its the parachain slot auctions. For Litecoin it's the implementation of Mimblewimble, and so on. These are things you must absolutely know going into the next few months, because the top might just pass you by if you're not paying attention. Luckily for you, I also happen to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGd6O79_MOc&amp;t=2s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how to plan your ultimate altcoin exit strategy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further to this point, it helps to be familiar with the basics of technical analysis. Believe it or not, I'm actually not the biggest fan of TA because what you see can, and often does, contradict itself depending on the timeframe and the pairing you're looking at (pairing with BTC vs. USD for example). However, when the market is getting very greedy and emotional the way it is now, technical analysis can become very powerful for shorter term trading. You can get started by watching my first technical analysis tutorial </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW3eWIj3Q04"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There may also be tax implications for taking profits right now. What implications you personally have will of course depend on where you are resident and the local tax treatment for cryptocurrency. I have covered this in a previous </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMNSwa_PkkA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video on taxation.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, cover all of your bases! You may or may not have seen that Binance is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/51bf294e26324211a4731ca998e110ca"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requiring KYC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all users now. I reckon it's only a matter of time before other major offshore exchanges start following suit. So, don't bank on lax exchange controls to save you should crypto really go to the moon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the less reputable offshore exchanges may throw up excessive KYC requirements to keep a hold of your funds (the HitBTC playbook). So, if you wanted to pre-empt this then you could set yourself up with an account at a well regulated onshore exchange. There is quite a lot of selection out there at the moment but I covered 5 of the best in a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSj8smV63Es"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent video of mine.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üì¢ </span><b>New CoinBureau YouTube Channels</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üì¢</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve got an exciting announcement to make today. As many of you know, my team and I are on a mission to spread the good word of crypto to all four corners of the globe. But there is one major problem with that; not everyone speaks English. That is why I‚Äôve decided to launch </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCejCUsbK62MQ_-gA5WXqeuQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinBureau Japan!</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, you can find dubbed versions of my videos in Japanese! So, if your first language is Japanese then you might want to take a look at that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, that's not all!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite often, I get requests from viewers that would like to see some videos from behind the scenes. Some less polished videos that give the viewer a better perspective of exactly what is going on behind the scenes at the Bureau.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I have also launched </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR93yACeNzxMSk6Y1cHM2pw/featured"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinBureau Clips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is a channel dedicated to more bit-sized versions of my content. Not only will it include behind the scenes action, but it will also have content from my other socials like TikTok and instagram. I will also be taking shorter bits from my main channel and posting them here.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what are you waiting for?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Show the Bureau some love and hit that subscribe button on my new channels today! I‚Äôd super appreciate the support!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am sure all of you are aware that those crypto markets have been on a tear in the last week. Indeed, it seems as if we could be on the verge of a fresh alt rally this September.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, regulators are making it more difficult to use our exchange of choice. So, if you are only using one exchange, you should definitely consider expanding your options.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, which other options are there for stacking those alts?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>FTX:</b> <a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/ftx/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is crypto‚Äôs rising stars and it is operated by one of the most successful crypto VC‚Äôs in the space; Alameda Research.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is perhaps the fastest growing crypto exchange out there. Bank and card deposits are supported in numerous currencies like USD, EUR, CAD, GBP and AUD.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even better, there are around 100 altcoins on the shelves over here and the fees are highly competitive. In terms of additional features, you get access to staking, prediction markets and a plethora of exotic markets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve been able to secure you guys a special deal. If you sign up through the Coin Bureau, you‚Äôll get your first </span><b>$30 in trading fees for free!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After that, you‚Äôll get a </span><b>10% trading fee discount for life!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This stacks on top of any discounts you get for holding FTT tokens - great for optimizing your exchange fees.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanna see what the fuss is all about?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/ftx/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign Up To FTX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; Get Your First </span><b>$30</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In Trading Fees For </span><b>FREE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> + </span><b>10% FEE Discount!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üá®üá≠ </span><b>Swissborg:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Swissborg app is certainly worth giving a try if you are based in Europe or the UK.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What‚Äôs cool is that they support a ton of different fiat currencies like GBP, CAD, EUR, ZAR, DKK, SGD, SEK, CHF, NOK, PLN, RON, HUF, HKD, CZK or ILS. That means you can buy crypto and altcoin with fiat, without nasty exchange rate fees!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to see how easy it is to buy crypto with fiat here? Well, just </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiw5rp3zoo0&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watch my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">showing you exactly how to do that on Swissborg!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if you deposit ‚Ç¨50 you‚Äôll get up to </span><b>‚Ç¨100 FREE in CHSB tokens!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So, you might want to take advantage of that offer.</span>

		<Title>August 29, 2021 - Bitcoin Futures ETFs!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<div>
<div>
<div>Hey Guys,</div>
<div>It seems as if there is a great deal of excitement around the potential for a Bitcoin ETF. There are currently over 17 applications that are outstanding - some of which appear to be in the final stages of review.</div>
<div>However, there is one thing that many people have not considered and that is what form these ETFs will take‚Ä¶</div>
<div>Basically, there are quite a few indications right now that the SEC is more likely to approve those ETFs that are backed by CME Bitcoin Futures.</div>
<div>These are not the ETFs that the crypto community has been hoping for. These are synthetic and won‚Äôt have any long term impact on the spot market. There is also a really strong likelihood that they could make the Bitcoin markets more unstable and less efficient.</div>
<div>This is a topic that I will be covering in my video today. I will be explaining exactly what futures ETFs are and how they are structured.

<div></div>
<div>Maybe it's just me, but there seem to be a lot of people out there saying that the run up we've seen over the last few weeks is just a bull trap. Put simply, that‚Äôs a price pump after the main rally which tricks traders into FOMOing back in just before the big crash comes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The people pushing these narratives were convinced that the market was finished last week, and then boom, last minute reversal! So, what the hell happened? Why did we dip and then rebound?</div>
<div></div>
<div>My theory up until Friday was that the BTC price was being suppressed by hedging around Bitcoin options expiries. Quite simply, there were over $2 billion worth of options that were expiring on Friday. Depending on how the options are positioned (Puts vs. Call expiry and strike prices), the expiry itself has an impact on the spot market.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is mostly as a result of market makers adjusting their hedges in the spot market to account for the options expiries. There are also some who think that whales try to impact on the spot market while trading options (although harder to prove). If this all sounds foreign to you, don‚Äôt worry, I have covered it in great detail in my video on¬†<a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/nv4oNtOyxu1_VaS9U_dBrwCNeibML3CfjKb7lswI9R9GGtBdVCFLwqCqIDwDvW_87j6IO3a0-VGH9lGMUr4KIJokv0HAaDYkHBbl2yO5agVJsrSBOcS1K8kfR6zzfxny5ZwvU6fBVp2bwsBMCi30WM4sGOz7_LQzdbsNfzizp-u7mzpRbNwz4FAfKCmyFA" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/nv4oNtOyxu1_VaS9U_dBrwCNeibML3CfjKb7lswI9R9GGtBdVCFLwqCqIDwDvW_87j6IO3a0-VGH9lGMUr4KIJokv0HAaDYkHBbl2yO5agVJsrSBOcS1K8kfR6zzfxny5ZwvU6fBVp2bwsBMCi30WM4sGOz7_LQzdbsNfzizp-u7mzpRbNwz4FAfKCmyFA&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630339479233000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgLWl9XqX_WoRbuNM2hTr7OyWEog">options trading data.</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>The long and the short of it (pardon the pun) is that the market makers were selling Bitcoin in the runup to the expiry in order to adjust their hedges. There is also a possibility that some bears with puts could also have been trying to reduce the impact of their losses. In the end, the result was that the moment we rolled past the expiry, the sell pressure evaporated and the pulls could continue pushing the price higher.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, having said that, it turns out that the bigger factor at play was the Federal Reserve.</div>
<div></div>
<div>FED Chairman Jerome Powell was set to make a speech on Friday as part of the Jackson Hole Symposium, an annual meet up for money printers (read central banks). The markets were nervous that Jerome would announce a cutback in Fed spending. More specifically, the purchases of government bonds.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If this were to happen, interest rates in the United States would rise. And, as we know from Macroeconomics 101, a rise in interest rates has big implications for the broader economy. Companies find it harder to fund growth and overleveraged companies (and people) find it harder to service debts.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The combination of less company investment and individual share sales leads to a market crash. Moreover, even the knowledge that a tapering is about to happen is likely to precipitate the decline as market participants get ready for it - pretty gloomy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If BTC's price didn't give it away, Jerome danced around the issue of tapering and implied that the FED would not be cutting back on spending any time soon. Various indexes in the stock market hit all time highs as a result. Crazy how that works, right?</div>
<div>Anyways, The Federal Reserve is scheduled to have a press conference on September 21-22, which is when they could potentially announce a taper. This will likely depend on what the inflation numbers look like for August, and we will know that sometime in mid September. Although, given recent inflation trends, it's likely to be higher than most had expected.</div>

<div>However, irrespective of whether this speech is protected, banks (and by extension payment processors) have decided that they will be the moral arbitrators for us all.

While they cited exploitation, it's more than likely they used it as an excuse to finally pull the plug. They only reinstated services once the platform completely banned user generated uploads.

<div></div>
<div>So, why am I telling you this?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, it‚Äôs nothing to do with porn. It‚Äôs all to do with the banks. The fact that they have so much power to pick and choose which industries are allowed to thrive and which must die. This is something that we have all experienced when it comes to cryptocurrency. In some places, it's near impossible to get a business bank account for a crypto related business.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Don‚Äôt believe me? Try and speak to any of the UK banks and see how quickly the door will be shut when they find out you are involved in cryptocurrency. This is something that many of you will have seen with your personal accounts as well.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Cryptocurrency is also not alone.

It explains how the government deputised banks through a program called ‚ÄúOperation Choke Point‚Äù.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The long and the short of it is that the DOJ &amp; FDIC was able to exert power over the banks in order to get them to limit services to politically disfavoured industries. An example of this was the firearms industry, where numerous banks decided to illegally deplatform merchants.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The point is that banks have the power to destroy businesses that they don‚Äôt like. It could be politicians leaning on them to do it. Or it could be other pressure groups that are trying to drive a narrative. And while now they can do it to porn, crypto or guns - they could do it to anyone.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The same argument could of course be said about other centralised systems that deplatform people and companies. Power that rests in the hands of a few can marginalise anyone they like.</div>
<div></div>
<div>That is why I am so ideologically aligned with cryptocurrency and decentralisation. Yes, we are in a battle against the banks, regulators &amp; politicians. However, it's a battle worth fighting because decentralisation is one of the only ways in which we can limit our dependence on the good graces of the men in suits.</div>

Title: Redditor bet life savings on Bitcoin and lost it all.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It made me wonder how on earth that was even possible especially given that Bitcoin had not collapsed during the week. Then, when I read a bit deeper into the story, it turned out that the redditor had in fact lost his life savings¬†<strong>by using leverage</strong>. Now, I don‚Äôt want to get into how misleading this title is. However, it is a good opportunity to once again warn about the risks that come from leveraged trading.</div>
<div>Futures and other leveraged instruments are not safe for beginners and are far too often shilled as a way to multiply gains. In reality, they are also a method in which you can multiply your losses if you are positioned the wrong way. Moreover, there is so much manipulation going on in the unregulated Bitcoin futures market that whales are often able to use their heft to liquidate the smaller newbies.</div>
<div>I will also say that I know many wealthy crypto investors and very few of them have engaged in leveraged trading. Those that have, have extensive experience in these instruments and rarely ever go over 5x leverage. They have openly told me about how the futures game is stacked against the smaller retail traders. Some have even railed at how unstable it makes the Bitcoin markets (something I will be covering in an upcoming video).</div>
<div>On top of all this, when users do tend to use this leverage and lose their savings, we get these sorts of headlines. Headlines which can‚Äôt discern between a risky leveraged bet and a simple ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù strategy. These continue to perpetuate the narrative that cryptocurrency is too risky to invest in. It will continue to invite overburdensome regulation from government agencies.</div>
<div>So please guys, just don‚Äôt do it!</div>

		<Title>September 5, 2021 - NEVER Do This While Trading Crypto!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of risks in the crypto markets, known and unknown. As I have mentioned previously, September could be a month where some of these risks manifest themselves.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Irrespective of what happens though, there is one factor that is likely to make the impact of these risks that much more severe - and that factor is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">leverage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have talked about the risks that leverage poses to the individual trader on a number of occasions. However, there is a far greater risk to the broader crypto markets from the high levels of leverage we see. Leverage that is taken on through unregulated and disparate offshore exchanges.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So today, I am going to do a deep dive expos√© on the market instability that is caused by leveraged trading. I will be breaking down the leveraged trading sector and explaining how minor price moves can lead to flash crashes that unnecessarily increase Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I will also show you how both of Bitcoin‚Äôs largest crashes over the past 2 years have been exacerbated by leverage.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that</span> <a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzgSwgU_3G4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.&nbsp;</span></a>

<b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Took a bit of profit on ADA &amp; SOL. Both have had some pretty crazy rallies recently and want to lock in some gains on the way up. I am allocating a bit of this to DOT and the rest split 50/50 between PAXG &amp; USDC.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that DOT has some pretty strong potential over the next few weeks. The Kusama PLOs have got off to a strong start and this is a harbinger of things to come on Polkadot when they get going.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of other coins I am looking at, there are some really interesting projects being built in the Solana ecosystem. I will be keeping a close eye on them and update you on moves in my </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Updated portfolio here:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 28.69% | BTC 23.11% | SOL 14.71% | ADA 6.86% | DOT 6.02% | PAXG 4.74% | USDC 4.56% | RUNE 2.33% | INJ 2.31% | ATOM 1.77% | MATIC 1.32% | AR 1.24% | LINK 1.24% | YFI 0.84% | LIT 0.26%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically September has been a very bad month for Bitcoin, but so far we haven't seen history repeat itself. This doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet, however. Besides the fact that past performance doesn't predict future performance, there are a lot of bearish events and developments on the horizon for the crypto industry.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of these bearish events is the regulatory crackdown that could be the result of that infrastructure bill which will likely pass in late September / early October. If you aren't quite convinced that this is a threat yet, take a second to consider the recent news that the Treasury is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://decrypt.co/79823/treasury-wants-crypto-reporting-rules-trillion-reconciliation-bill-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trying to add MORE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crypto provisions to the OTHER 'infrastructure bill'. To me, this just shows how eager regulators are to go after crypto, and some of them aren't waiting around anymore.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned in my weekly crypto review a few weeks back, the SEC </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/4mNqN7cxiKI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seems to be dead set</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on taking down DeFI, and it's possible that the first of many moves has officially taken place. This is of course the news that Uniswap Labs is under investigation, though this has not yet been officially confirmed by SEC officials nor members of Uniswap Labs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Uniswap is technically a decentralized protocol, the website we use to access it (the interface) was built and is maintained by Uniswap Labs. This means that if the regulators really wanted to twist their arm, they could require further monitoring on the uniswap.exchange front end.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily the markets haven't responded too negatively to this news, and it's probably because there are boatloads of "more decentralized" alternatives, namely SushiSwap. Moreover, someone can just as easily host the Uniswap front end somewhere else and fork the code - the beauty of open source.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, this looks like it could be the beginning of a bigger trend, and the real jugular DeFi needs to protect is stablecoins. Just last week, Canadian regulators </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/115804/ontario-securities-regulator-bars-the-countrys-first-registered-crypto-platforms-from-trading-tether"><span style="font-weight: 400;">barred cryptocurrency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exchanges from listing / trading the USDT stablecoin issued by Tether.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This news was somewhat missed by the crypto media, yet it too could be a sign of bigger things to come. Keep your eyes peeled on the news this week and ask yourself what effects regulatory actions, if any, could have on the crypto market as well as your own portfolio.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, while things appear bearish on the regulatory front, it's slightly more optimistic on the global macro front...</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ü§î </span><b>One Risk Off The Table ü§î</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who watched </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cvUpAy_aXQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two weeks ago about some of the risks and opportunities of Bitcoin, one of those risks was that the Fed would start to taper their bond buying program. </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-yields-edge-higher-after-talk-of-fed-tapering-11629485683"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was talk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of this happening because of higher inflation and an improving job market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, this mere talk caused markets to fall on the realisation that they would have to be weaned off of their easy money crack. Bitcoin was not immune to this and it also </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-slides-with-s-p500-as-fed-signals-tapering-120b-monthly-bond-purchases"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fell post release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the July fed meeting minutes. As I have said before, Bitcoin is now in a ‚Äúrisk on‚Äù bucket for global investors and it is becoming negatively correlated with interest rates.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it seems as if this risk has somewhat subsided this week. That is because we had jobs data that appeared to show the recovery </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/jobs-report-august-2021.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is not as strong</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as first hoped. This therefore means that the Fed is unlikely to want to taper for fear of hampering an already weak recovery. This was of course a signal to the stock markets that the Fed money party will continue - and they rallied in response.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs still pretty crazy to me that bad news for the broader economy can be construed as good news for the markets, but that‚Äôs where we are right now. Either way, this also helped to propel Bitcoin as it broke the $50k level again.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, it seems as if everyone has once again forgotten the other reason as to why the Fed was considering tapering and that is because of the risks of inflation. I know that I have been talking about inflation for over a year now but it really is coming to a head. I have heard from so many people about how much prices have gone up over the past year. It‚Äôs permeating society.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, not all of this is driven by Fed policy (demand pull). A great deal of it is also coming from critical shortages and the cost increases that come from it. This is the ‚Äúcost push‚Äù or supply shock that has been driven by disruptions caused by the pandemic.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also likely to get that much worse on the back of </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/surging-covid-19-cases-hammer-asian-factories-11630496589"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surging Covid cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the region. Factories in China, Vietnam &amp; Malaysia have had to either close down or reduce capacity. This will mean further shortages for everything from Semiconductors to shoes. In order to remain profitable, these factories will have to increase their prices. On top of that, the cost of shipping these goods to the US and Europe is </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1430869848888856584?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at record highs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what does this mean for Bitcoin?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I still maintain that it‚Äôs a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw6giyX7DhE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly effective hedge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against inflation. Moreover, if there is a situation in which we have a toxic combination of low growth &amp; inflation (stagflation), it‚Äôs likely to be one of the few </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc9y0Uuxg7c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">global macro lifeboats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most interesting data points to watch will of course be the August CPI numbers. These are due to come out on the 14th of September. I happen to have a feeling that they will once again be above expectations.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it‚Äôs good to know that at least the ‚ÄúTaper risk‚Äù is off the cards for Bitcoin and the markets for some time. However, don‚Äôt forget those other risks.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Trading Tips </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over this last week I must have received over a dozen messages from friends saying they are back in the green after buying the top back in April and May. This is definitely good news, but the crypto market is slowly starting to look a bit frothy.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I said the same thing </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1391413151804137479"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back then and I'll say it again today - the market might soon start getting a bit overheated, and when that happens you have to make sure you're taking some money off the table.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're one of the unlucky few who has not yet seen their altcoins moon, I have one word for you: patience. One of my mates is a die hard Litecoin holder and he was on the verge of selling his stash before LTC started pumping like crazy. Typically when your favorite crypto hasn't rallied, it just means it hasn't YET.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This obviously depends on the cryptocurrency we're dealing with, but as a general rule of thumb, anything in the top 20 and especially top 10 by market cap will follow BTC sooner or later.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you happen to be holding a meme coin though, you might be out of luck. As hyped as this market has been, we still haven't seen nearly the same amount of buzz as the spring by all metrics (e.g. Google Search Trends, crypto fear and greed index).&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This could mean that there are still bigger gains to be had, but it could also mean that what we're seeing now is one big bull trap. To be clear, I'm not saying that this is a bull trap, but it's important to be cognisant of the different outcomes and what the likelihood of them happening is.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings me to my final point, and that's expectations...&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I've lost count of the outrageous price predictions I've seen now that the bull market is back on the menu. The brutal truth is nobody knows how high or low the crypto market could go in the coming months. If you're holding altcoins, their upside potential will be limited by Bitcoin, specifically Bitcoin's market cap.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be honest with yourself about the coins and tokens you're holding and set reasonable expectations on when to take profits and cash out. This is what I do as part of my own crypto strategy which will be making a video about soon - so keep your eyes peeled for that.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you want to take advantage of those crypto markets and stay away from that dangerous leverage trading?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üí∂ </span><b>Best Way To Buy &amp; Trade Crypto: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it is no secret that I am no fan of leveraged trading. But so many exchanges have those leveraged markets hidden away and the truth is that some people out there are tempted to use them.</span>

<b>What‚Äôs the solution?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Setup an account at a top crypto exchange that doesn‚Äôt offer leveraged markets!&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My top pick here would be the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/swissborg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swissborg app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I actually use it myself to get in and out of those crypto markets and to do a bit of trading on the go. Now, if you have been in crypto and your local currency isn‚Äôt a major global one like the EUR, then you‚Äôll be all too aware of those annoying fees for switching currencies. Swissborg offers support for 16 different fiat currencies. Some of these are pretty exotic, like the South African Rand and Emirati Dirham.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All that makes Swissborg the perfect option for those wanting to get into crypto, whilst avoiding currency conversion fees.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Swissborg offers access to a reasonable selection of cryptos and that includes some more exotic plays like Enjin Coin, REN and Chiliz.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of all that, the app gives you easy access to some cracking crypto interest rates. </span><b>Interest rates as high as 9%</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are available here!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if you deposit ‚Ç¨50 then you‚Äôll get up to </span><b>‚Ç¨100 FREE </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in CHSB tokens!&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üï¥Ô∏è </span><b>Best Crypto Tax Solution:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sadly, taxes are an everyday reality. Sure, you can pretend those gains never happened. However, I personally would rather sleep well at night. If you are in the same camp as me, you‚Äôll want to make sure your tax calculations are as painless as possible.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, you could do all that yourself by learning about your country‚Äôs tax rules and then spending days playing around with excel spreadsheets. However, those that value their time are going to want to grab a dedicated crypto tax solution, which automates nearly everything for you.</span>

		<Title>September 12, 2021 - These NFTs are off the CHAIN!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you thought that the crypto markets were crazy, the NFT space is absolutely bewildering. What most thought would be a passing fad earlier this year is hotter than ever. People are quite literally making 1,000x returns on NFT collectibles that are barely a month old.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the skeptic in me says: This is all hype and it‚Äôs going to cost investors a lot of crypto.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But the inquisitive me asks: Is there something more??</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that is exactly what I am going to cover today. I am going to be taking a deep dive into the NFT collectible space and analysing what they are and why they are perceived to have value.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I will also be going over some of the hottest collections in the space and giving me opinion on their long term potential.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a really interesting video to research and shoot, so I hope you guys enjoy watching it - </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>

<b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Took some profit on my SOL, ADA &amp; BTC allocation. I will be allocating some of this to UST and some to ATOM.&nbsp; The allocation to UST is because I think it‚Äôs important to start diversifying my stablecoin risk - more on this below&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to my ATOM allocation, I think that it‚Äôs relatively undervalued compared to how fundamental Cosmos is to numerous different cryptocurrency projects &amp; ecosystems - an updated video is coming in the next week or so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There were no other changes in my portfolio this week. I may consider picking up an NFT or two but so far I am not entirely comfortable with their valuations. As usual, I will keep you updated in my </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram Channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the ONLY official one).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 25.93% | BTC 20.75% | SOL 17.75% | DOT 7.10% | ADA 4.95% | PAXG 4.82% | USDC 4.68% | ATOM 3.21% | INJ 2.13% | RUNE 2.05% | UST 2% | AR 1.44% | LINK 1.18% | MATIC 1.11% | YFI 0.70% | LIT 0.20%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Things are looking a bit shaky on the charts right now, and this is for a few reasons...</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, there's </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-11/stablecoins-face-crackdown-as-u-s-discusses-risk-council-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the US Treasury Department will soon be taking its first actions against stablecoin issuers, starting with Tether (USDT). This comes on the heels </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://decrypt.co/80655/rise-stablecoins-defi-make-central-bank-currencies-urgent-bank-international-settlements"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; that the Bank of International Settlements is pushing central banks to begin developing their own central bank digital currencies as a response to stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. Any punitive action against a stablecoin like Tether could have massive implications for the crypto space.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily it looks like one crypto project is already stepping in to take on the role as crypto's top stablecoin. Terra's LUNA coin has been pumping even while the rest of the market slumps, and that's because LUNA is used to collateralize the UST stablecoin.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When demand for UST rises, the price of LUNA responds in kind. If you pop open CoinMarketCap for UST, you can see its market cap has risen sharply, meaning boatloads of UST are being minted. If this confuses you, don't worry. I'll be doing an update about Terra this week and it will explain everything, including whether Terra could replace Tether and other stablecoins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, US politicians are set to reveal the entirety of their upcoming </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/whats-in-the-3-trillion-biden-infrastructure-plan-democrats-are-working-on-2021-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.5 trillion human infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bill. This is a different bill than the 1 trillion dollar infrastructure bill which contains that controversial tax reporting clause which could be damaging to crypto.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the fact that the Treasury Department is also trying to sneak some anti crypto provisions into the second infrastructure bill, capital gains taxes </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2021/09/03/capital-gains-tax-hike-and-more-may-come-just-after-labor-day/?sh=44a867c0903c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could be doubled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 20% to 39% for wealthy Americans. Naturally, the practical effects of this would be a massive sell off across the board, and we're already seeing the cracks starting to form in the stock market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings me to the third point, and that's the stock market. Some of you might have </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/fed-officials-sell-stocks-avoid-apparent-conflict-interest-2021-09-09/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seen the news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Federal Reserve officials are planning on selling their stocks by the end of the month to "avoid a conflict of interest".&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is of course in reference to the fact that the FED's monetary policy has a massive effect on the stock market, and it seems that a few FED officials have been taking advantage of that to their gain.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as I can tell, a lot of traders are taking this as a sign that the Top is in for the stock market. I reckon that's not a farfetched assumption to make. As we know, cryptocurrencies have become highly correlated with stocks and they would likely follow the stock market lower should we see a global crash.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While this may be disconcerting to many, it‚Äôs not all bad news. I‚Äôm particularly excited about Cardano which will be shipping its highly anticipated smart contract upgrade in a few hours. This will unlock the same DeFi features we find on Ethereum, Solana, and other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ADA is probably rallying as you read this, but I do have a word of caution for anyone holding ADA...&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As Charles Hoskinson himself noted, this release is more like an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and there will likely be a few bugs and issues. So, don't set your expectations too high. Don't be discouraged by these shortcomings either. They will be addressed in future hard forks, as well as by the dApp developers themselves. I'll be going over a few of the top projects building on Cardano this week, so stay tuned for that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üôÑ </span><b>The SEC Sues Coinbase üôÑ</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week we got the news that the SEC was investigating Uniswap. However this week, we learned that they had far bigger targets in mind with </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/08/coinbase-shares-fall-after-it-reveals-sec-plans-to-sue-over-interest-earning-product.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their intention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to sue Coinbase over their Coinbase Lend feature.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, despite what you think of Coinbase, the actions taken by the SEC here are really disappointing. This is because of the manner in which it was done. According to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by their Chief Legal Officer, they have no idea why they are being sued - this despite their repeated efforts to engage with the SEC.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From the announcement, it appears that the SEC is viewing Coinbase Lend as offering unregistered securities. While the CLO of Coinbase makes a case for why it is not a security, the SEC is applying decades old cases (Howey &amp; Reves) in order to come to that conclusion. I have talked about the Howey test on many occasions on my channel but it could be construed that products like Lend can be classified as securities. However, nothing can be done by Coinbase as the SEC is refusing to talk to them about it at all.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs quite unfortunate to hear this. Especially when Gary Gensler was himself </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asking those</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the crypto space to come and engage with them. Moreover, given Gary‚Äôs background in teaching blockchain tech at MIT, one would have thought that he would have been more reasonable (or at least more engaged) with the community.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What I find most frustrating about this is that it seems as if these actions go against the explicit mission of the SEC and that is to protect retail investors. The Coinbase Lend feature would have given users the ability to safely earn 4% on their USDC. By restricting these users from earning that interest, they are forcing them to invest in money markets </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/SEC_Investor_Ed/status/1435606347807006728?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and bonds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which have interest rates near zero - pathetic when you consider inflation.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not just crypto lending that is a target. DeFi protocols have become increasingly wary of stepping on the toes of the SEC - so much so that they are excluding US users all together. We saw this recently with the DYDX airdrop that I talked about in my </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1101"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post here.&nbsp;</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That was an airdrop. It was free crypto that users could have earned for using the protocol. Retail DeFi users in the US were not allowed to partake. However, those large VC funds and ‚Äúaccredited investors‚Äù sure did fill their pockets with the token allocation to the initial investors.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Was the SEC really protecting the retail investors? And, if they are merely following the law without consideration to consequences, should they really be applying an 80 year old case to it?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be interesting to see where we go from here. Coinbase seems like they intend to take the fight to the SEC. This could be a great outcome according to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1435700343011217416"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Cuban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they have the resources and heft to do so. Smaller Defi builders and protocols don‚Äôt.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I also think that we have not seen the last of these lawsuits. Other centralised lending platforms in the US like BlockFi could be the next target (they have already </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d6c19d4-4848-4c0e-8112-5cff52dd1cbd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been restricted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in some states). The SEC could go after more Defi builders and lending platforms as well.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I seriously hope that going forward there is more guidance and less litigation.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Newbie Tips </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember last week when I warned you guys about the risks of leverage trading?&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I wish that edition of the newsletter had found its way to every crypto holder...&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week's big drop </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1096"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was primarily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to liquidations on cryptocurrency exchanges. Overleveraged traders caused over 3 billion dollars of sell pressure for BTC, and that caused its price to flash crash down to 43k. Please guys, keep that leverage to a minimum, especially with all the uncertainty in the market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are some trying times to say the least. It feels like crypto could pump or dump at any second, and even the slightest deviation to the upside or downside could have you feeling the FOMO and FUD. As I've said before, when in doubt, zoom out.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what happens in the near term, it's quite clear where we're headed in the long term. This is something that should calm your nerves, and if it hasn't you're probably overleveraged (invested too much). If you're not overleveraged and are still stressed, consider checking out </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTawU1SZrBY&amp;t=438s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how to deal with crypto stress.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that I didn't mention in that video is the stress that comes with being married to a project. I reckon it's something I've discussed here before, but going all-in on a single crypto coin or token isn't wise. It can really cloud your judgement about what's going on with that project.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, if you use social media platforms to get information on said project, there is a risk you could be in an echo chamber. That is because the algorithms are designed to present you with the information that most conforms with content you like - in this case hype about a cryptocurrency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially relevant now that the market is looking weak. Your end game is to protect your gains, and some cryptos will take the dips worse than others. Ask yourself if yours is on that list. Hint: the smaller the market cap, the larger the loss you're likely to see in the event of a dip.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of dips, some of you may be eager to see prices drop down to levels you were hoping to buy back in at. This is definitely a good mindset to have, but it can also lead to the risk of wanting to buy the very bottom. This is just as difficult if not more difficult than selling the top.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EADLE7kO4tA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about my top crypto trading strategy, I tend to pay attention to historical zones of price support, as well as my own percentage gains or losses. The latter can really come in handy when nothing on the charts makes sense, and that's been the case a lot these days.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are dead set on buying the dip though, make sure to check </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prkv45GfGUg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">out my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about it here.

		<Title>September 19, 2021 - Here‚Äôs How To Save ETH GAS!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs no secret. Ethereum gas fees are one of the main reasons that people are trying to migrate to other alternative cryptocurrencies.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the decision does not have to be between different cryptocurrencies but between different solutions all within the Ethereum ecosystem.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now there are Ethereum layer 2 solutions that are helping it scale and helping to reduce the gas burden for the users. These are offchain solutions such as the Polygon Network, Optimism and Arbitrum.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past few weeks, I have been using some of these to conduct my own Defi swaps and it has been a breath of fresh air. Imagine Uniswap transactions completing in under ¬º of a second or at fees almost 15x cheaper than that on the main chain!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That is all a reality when you migrate off the beaten chain. So, in the video today, I take a deep dive into Ethereum sidechain and layer 2 solutions. Not only do I explain all the tech but I also give you a complete step-by-step guide to using them.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Start </span><b>saving gas now</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/L52zhkDYzvM"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">watch my video.</span></a>

<b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Took a bit more profit on SOL and closed out of YFI. These are being split 50/50 into an allocation of PAXG &amp; UST. The latter is because I want to keep dry powder in a decentralised stablecoin and if you saw my</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLmVtec0px4"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">video on Terra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you will know why I am diversifying away from USDC.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to PAXG, this is because I want to diversify to a traditional risk hedge (gold). However, I would prefer to hold tokenised gold given how easy it is to get in and out of it.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of other projects that are on my horizon, I am still considering more allocation to DOT &amp; ATOM. I also have my eyes on ALGO and am currently doing a video on Algorand - so stay tuned for that.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, I will keep you updated in my official</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram Channel.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 25.76% | BTC 21.83% | SOL 14.91% | DOT 7.53% | PAXG 5.65% | UDSC 4.78% | ADA 4.53% | ATOM 4.29% | UST 2.90% | RUNE 2.23% | INJ 1.88% | LINK 1.20% | AR 1.18% | MATIC 1.12% | LIT 0.22%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, September has been anything but uneventful. As volatile as the markets have been, there are still a few things that you need to have on your radar over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, regulators are continuing their crackdown on crypto, specifically stablecoins and crypto lending and borrowing. The FED and Treasury really</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/treasury-to-flag-stablecoin-perils-as-u-s-readies-clampdown"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">don‚Äôt like</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dollars floating around that they can't control.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Wall Street doesn't like the billions of dollars flooding into interest bearing stablecoins on platforms like Celcius and Coinbase, the former of which is now</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/texas-and-new-jersey-regulators-go-after-celsius-network"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">feeling the heat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 3 US states. As I mentioned a few weeks ago, this was likely to happen in the wake of the moves by these states to clamp down on BlockFi.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether we are likely to see a national move by the SEC on crypto lending and stablecoins depends on whether they are likely to get given any special powers in congress. Many in congress have already been working with the SEC to see what sort of powers they are able to give (see Gary‚Äôs testimony section below).&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of timeline, I don‚Äôt expect much to happen until they have voted on that infrastructure bill and it looks like the</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/572736-hoyer-affirms-house-will-vote-sept-27-on-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">official date</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for that will be September the 27th.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, there are other concerning things for crypto popping up at the last minute, namely an additional</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://decrypt.co/81236/overlooked-part-senate-infrastructure-bill-renews-worries-crypto-lobby"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">anti-crypto provision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the infrastructure bill that was missed by crypto analysts. I mean, who can blame them? The damn thing is over 2700 pages long and written in legal speak!&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, in a nutshell, this oversight provision means US citizens will have to report any crypto transaction they received that's worth more than $10 000. Obviously that's a problem, because this involves collecting personal information on the sender, which is impossible with DeFi protocols.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a cherry on top, we have this Evergrande situation happening in China. I've talked about it before and gave a summarised breakdown in this</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1115"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Apart from the risks around general global market contagion, there are also concerns about what impact it could have on the commercial paper market. As we know, stablecoin issuers like Tether hold almost half of all their assets in this commercial paper. I will be doing a complete video on it so be sure to keep those eyes peeled.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not all doom and gloom though. There are a number of positive developments within the crypto space.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutions are still looking to increase their exposure to the crypto space. We have recently had</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/fidelity-pushed-for-bitcoin-etf-approval-in-private-sec-meeting"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Fidelity held a private meeting with the SEC where they were pushing the case for their Bitcoin ETF. This is important because Fidelity is one of the largest asset managers in the world and perhaps the most well known applicant for an ETF.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprisingly enough, Fidelity believes that Bitcoin belongs in the same safe haven category as precious metals and bonds. The global asset manager has also been making numerous positive overtures towards Bitcoin, some of which I covered in my video on Fidelity‚Äôs recent</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2otrUKwehc8"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">research report.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over in the altcoin space, we have the news that Avalanche has just</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/avalanche-raises-230-million-from-private-sale-of-avax-tokens/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">raised over $230m</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to jumpstart its Defi ecosystem. This now places the project on par with Solana when it comes to firepower. They both have unique tech stacks and it will be interesting to see their ecosystems evolve in the coming months.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, despite all the Global Macro risks and regulatory headaches, the crypto ecosystem is still growing and it's the latter that I am focused on in the long term. It‚Äôs important to be optimistic about the future without being blinded to certain risks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üá∫üá∏ </span><b>Gary‚Äôs Testimony üá∫üá∏</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite recently, I</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPBR3mn6wKU"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">did a video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that tried to break down the SECs thinking about cryptocurrency. Well, this week we had a pretty comprehensive look into the lens with which the Chairman views the financial and crypto markets. This was at a hearing before the senate banking committee.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There was quite a lot of ground covered but there were a few things that stuck out for me‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, there is the view that Gary holds that ‚Äúdozens of assets‚Äù that are trading on Coinbase are unregistered securities. While this was no doubt a dig at Coinbase (given their legal spat), it raised a lot of questions in my mind as to which assets they could be referring to. There is no shortage of candidates who meet the rough definition of the Howey Test.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, Gensler is of the view that cryptocurrency is just for speculation and he dismissed the idea that it could be a path to financial freedom. This is a view that was also</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/117651/elizabeth-warren-and-gary-gensler-place-coinbase-in-oversight-crosshairs"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">shared by Elizabeth Warren</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which pointed to the crypto crash last week as evidence of retail investor risks.To me it seemed as if Warren sees Gensler as an ally at the SEC - one who can do the bidding of the (anti)progressive caucus.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirdly, it‚Äôs the fact that although these agencies and politicians want to regulate defi, they don‚Äôt seem to have a strong grasp of it. For example, Warren said that "the fee to swap between two tokens on the Ethereum network last Tuesday was more than $500."</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that number sounding highly inflated, we all know that gas fees are driven by market factors. They are protocol defined and are designed to adjust based on competition for block inclusion. Warren seems to think that the Ethereum blockchain is ripping off users on their fees.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As shocking as this is, it was</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1437810201739071498?s=20"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary‚Äôs response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to her question about gas fees which is most frustrating. He claimed that the fees on the decentralised exchanges were ‚Äúwhatever the exchange outlined in their user agreement‚Äù. I could give him the benefit of the doubt and say perhaps he misspoke, but it‚Äôs clear that the regulators are not fully in tune with what makes Defi tick.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn‚Äôt all that bad though. There were numerous Republican senators who wanted to stand up for the crypto sector. These included the likes of Pat Toomey who thought that the SEC‚Äôs ‚Äúregulation by enforcement‚Äù was wrongheaded. I also found</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/Y3AL5Okc6CQ?t=232"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this question</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by John Kennedy about whether Gary views himself as the ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù of those that he regulates to be amusing.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary also seems to be actually taking action on other more hot button issues. For example, he mentioned that he wants to</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/gensler-zeroes-in-on-citadel-securities-as-sec-considers-payment-for-order-flow-ban-191715790.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">try and limit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Payment for Order Flow activity and singled out specific hedge funds. If you don‚Äôt know what this is, I covered it in</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQou6xuXbk"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Robinhood and it‚Äôs one of the biggest sticking points in the battle between retail &amp; wall street.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a lot more that happened in this hearing and it was a full two hours long. I will be doing a video summary on it as well as its implications in the coming week - so watch out for that.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ùå </span><b>Crypto Market Manipulation </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ùå</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest misconceptions that I have seen out there is that because crypto is the ‚ÄúWild West‚Äù of financial markets, the same laws that apply to the traditional financial market can‚Äôt be applied to crypto. As I mentioned above, the regulators are becoming increasingly active in their enforcement and they are keen to apply their interpretations of securities law to crypto.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, cases around crypto market manipulation and insider trading could one day be pursued by the SEC or CFTC. Just this week, the CFTC has been looking into insider trading in the crypto derivatives market around exchange listings.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also had the case this week of the Open Sea head of product</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/nft-marketplace-opensea-says-employee-was-front-running-promos"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">buying collections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before they were showcased on the website. This meant that they were trading on inside information. In this case, the company asked for his resignation which seems like the correct course of action. However, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if somewhere down the line the SEC opens a case.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why am I telling you guys this?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I think it's important to point out that you should completely avoid any sort of ‚Äúinsider groups‚Äù or pump and dump channels. Any sort of activity that could be seen as market manipulation or trading on material non-public information should be avoided.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from being ethically wrong, it could one day come back to bite. It may seem relatively innocent at first but every action on the blockchain can be tracked and is permanent. If the regulators don‚Äôt have the resources to pursue wrongdoing now, they may in the future. And, there is nothing stopping them investigating market abuse 2-3 years from now.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Irrespective of whether there is a risk from the regulators, it‚Äôs important that we as a community root out these practices. That way those same regulators and politicians can‚Äôt use nefarious crypto activity as a reason to craft overburdensome regulations.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span>

<b>Top Rebalancing Tool: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you a crypto hodler? If so, you would no doubt have come across those situations in which your portfolio percentage balances go out of whack. Therefore, you are going to want to regularly rebalance those portfolio weights.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here‚Äôs the problem though; in order to do that, you‚Äôll need to get your calculator out, transfer coins to an exchange and send that crypto back to your wallet. Even worse, you might be doing that every week given how volatile the crypto markets can be.&nbsp;</span>

<b>What‚Äôs the answer?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The easy way to do all that is by using a top-notch crypto rebalancing tool like</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/shrimpy/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Shrimpy!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This tool allows you to automate all that and offers a plethora of other features like copy trading and much, much more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, I‚Äôve been able to get you an </span><b>exclusive 30% discount</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on all Shrimpy subscriptions too! So, if you like saving time and saving money then this is probably a deal that you‚Äôll want to look at!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Crazy Crypto Exchange Deal! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, one of the most common questions I am asked is: what is the best crypto exchange? The truth is that it all depends on your circumstances and what you want from an exchange. However, most people out there want to pay low fees, at a widely used exchange, which has a huge selection of altcoins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One option that ticks all those boxes is</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/kucoin/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kucoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I have been using the exchange personally in order to pick up some of the more exotic altcoins.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those that have followed the channel, you will have seen that I was able to secure a VIP level 3 upgrade at Kucoin for all viewers of the channel. However, that offering period lapsed a few months ago. It was taken down to level 2 which had a 44% trading fee discount.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While this was still better than all other deals out there, I was not satisfied. So, </span><b>I‚Äôve driven a hard bargain</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over there and I am pleased to say that all </span><b>NEW Kucoin users</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that sign up through the Bureau, will </span><b>get a VIP level 3 upgrade.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To get that normally, you‚Äôd need to buy and hold 20,000 KCS tokens. At the current market price, that would set you back a pretty mind boggling $235k.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, if you sign up under the Coin Bureau, you are eligible for that VIP level 3 tier. The main benefit with this is that you get a </span><b>trading fee discount of up to 60%!&nbsp;</b>

		<Title>September 26, 2021 - Catching Tokens BEFORE They Explode!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes it may seem that cryptocurrencies move in bizarre ways. One moment, there is almost no price action on a coin and the next day, it explodes seemingly out of the blue.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in reality, all of these moves can be preempted. It‚Äôs all about knowing which factors drive a cryptocurrency price pump. Factors that are completely public and tracked by numerous market participants.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what are those factors? And how can they be used to your advantage?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, I give you a 101 guide to tracking potential price pumps. It‚Äôs an overview of some of the most important metrics and events to track as well as the tools you can use to keep ahead of the pack.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>

<b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes in the portfolio this week folks. There was way too much volatility and I don‚Äôt see any really attractive opportunities at the moment. The reality is that we are not fully out of the woods when it comes to market volatility (see next section). So it‚Äôs prudent to keep that dry powder.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some projects in my sights though. I may be allocating a bit more to AR, especially if the Solana rally continues. I am also looking into Helium which has so far flown under my radar (will be doing a video later this week). You can keep up with my market moves in my dedicated </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 24.67% | BTC 21.64% | SOL 14.39% | DOT 7.50% | PAXG 6.18% | USDC 5.25% | ADA 5.12% | ATOM 4.88% | UST 3.17% | RUNE 1.96% | INJ 1.71% | AR 1.21% | LINK 1.10% | MATIC 1.04% | LIT 0.19%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, this September has been keeping up the tradition of prior Septembers. If you don‚Äôt know what I mean, give a gander to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.bitcoinmonthlyreturn.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this neat chart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that shows you the BTC ROI by month. September has historically been one of the bloodiest months for Bitcoin, and it looks like this month is going to continue that trend. The question is what comes next, and this is where things aren‚Äôt entirely clear. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of technicals, BTC is stuck between a rock and a hard place, specifically the 200-day and 128-day moving averages, both of which are significant zones of resistance and support, respectively. As I mentioned </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/EADLE7kO4tA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about my own personal trading strategy, these are zones that I watch closely. If we fall below the 128-day MA we could be in for some hurt, and even enter another bear slump like the one we saw after the crash back in May.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to on-chain though, things are looking pretty damn strong. Exchange balances of BTC and ETH continue to fall, and the percentage of BTC held by whales continues to rise. This basically means people are HODling and big money is buying the dip.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is certainly reassuring, but the increased volatility has resulted in a lot of liquidations from overleveraged traders. </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://decrypt.co/81395/over-1-billion-crypto-futures-liquidated-amid-evergrande-concerns"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According ByBit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, over 1.2 billion in BTC futures were liquidated over the last 7 days, and that sell pressure is clearly reflected in BTC‚Äôs price (those big bottom wicks on the daily candles).&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously all of these liquidations happened because of those Evergrande fears which I‚Äôll come back to in a moment. Right now, what you need to know is that another bearish bombshell could be coming to the crypto market, and that‚Äôs the passing of the infamous infrastructure bill. It looks like US politicians have agreed to vote to finally </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/573840-pelosi-bipartisan-infrastructure-vote-will-happen-monday"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pass the bill tomorrow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at which point all it takes is a signature from the president to become law.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those unfamiliar, this infrastructure bill contains not one but two anti-crypto clauses. The first requires poorly defined cryptocurrency ‚Äòbrokers‚Äô to collect KYC on all of their customers, and the second </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://decrypt.co/81236/overlooked-part-senate-infrastructure-bill-renews-worries-crypto-lobby"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requires reporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> any cryptocurrency transaction worth more than 10,000$.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This reporting is quite cumbersome and also involves collecting KYC from the counterparty. Neither of these two amendments are ideal, and the second one could make it impossible to interact with DeFi protocols as identity information about decentralized smart contracts doesn‚Äôt exist.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the bright side, it looks like the crypto market has already priced in these potential threats. Even if the market does dip tomorrow, it will only be because of a few FUDsters combined with that low volatility.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Big investors seem to be pretty comfortable with their continued allocations, and I reckon that has something to do with the increasing amount of influence they have over regulators like the SEC. If you didn‚Äôt get that memo, be sure to watch </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/-VWE3dY_jv4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üá®üá≥ </span><b>The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly! üá®üá≥</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That Good Ol‚Äô China FUD. Back with a vengeance this week on multiple fronts.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, we had one of the biggest crackdowns yet by the Peoples Bank of China on cryptocurrency businesses.&nbsp; The reason that this is one of the most consequential is because for the first time, it makes crypto-to-crypto transactions illegal. This includes those that are done on offshore exchanges.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They have not stopped there‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They also want to go after anyone who works for offshore exchanges offering services to citizens outside of China. So, if you live in China and work for any sort of crypto related exchange, you are liable to prosecution.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This was also the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1441331950774456330"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the authorities in China have mentioned Tether in their disclosure. For those that have any knowledge of the Chinese OTC market, USDT is one of the most popular methods by which people have been able to trade in and out of Bitcoin in the country.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But beyond what was said in these statements, one of the most important factors about these announcements is that they come with teeth. There were 10 agencies involved in the notice including three branches of China‚Äôs judicial system. This means that they are actively going to start pursuing cases against citizens for operating in violation of the ban.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a China watcher in </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/24/chinas-latest-crypto-ban-is-its-most-severe-insiders-say/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the crackdown is much more meaningful than the mining ban from earlier in the year. He said ‚ÄúIt could easily be construed as making anything related to crypto possibly illegal under the menu of statutes the notice cites.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, something to worry about?&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No, not really. Yes, prices fell on Friday as an immediate reaction to it, but it really wasn‚Äôt that meaningful in the context of crypto price swings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, this ‚ÄúChina Ban Crypto‚Äù FUD has become a meme in the crypto space. It has happened on so many occasions over the past 4 years that it loses meaning. Like the boy that cries wolf, eventually no one listens anymore.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the long term, this is actually positive. Like with the China Mining ban earlier this year, actions by the Chinese government force citizens and companies to invest elsewhere. That is exactly what has happened with </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider/976"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hashpower moving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the US and other countries.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If this really does place a nail in the coffin of retail trading in China, then the FUD will no longer grip the crypto markets and we can return to all time highs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, hopefully‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs if this Evergrande situation doesn‚Äôt spoil the party!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I know I have talked about it ad-nauseum but I really do think it's a big risk to all markets. If you don‚Äôt know what I am talking about, </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5g46Nk4PuM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my recent video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on it should explain it more in-depth.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The company missed a foreign bond interest payment and the Chinese government is starting to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-makes-preparations-for-evergrandes-demise-11632391852"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make preparations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the company‚Äôs demise. This is still likely to play itself out over the coming weeks but I wouldn‚Äôt ignore it as ‚Äúbaseless FUD‚Äù.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That is because fear can </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/21/fear-is-good-for-your-wallet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sometimes be good</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üíØ </span><b>Advanced Security Tips</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üíØ</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite often, I am asked by followers how I protect my cryptocurrency. I don‚Äôt always give the full breakdown as it can sometimes seem like a bit of overkill. I also don‚Äôt want to intimidate those new to the space with these relatively laborious processes (which they are sometimes).&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, I am sure that there are many that would benefit from some of these methods that I use. Methods that not only protect my cryptocurrency but also my privacy and personal cybersecurity.&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer Admins: The admin or ‚Äúmain‚Äù account on my PC / Mac is different from the account I use every day. That way, I have to fully approve all installations with the admin login credentials before they are installed. This is one additional barrier for Malware and it also means that if ever my PC is compromised via remote access they can‚Äôt get to a ‚Äúroot‚Äù user</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of which, be very wary of any software that gives remote access to your device in general. The most popular of these is perhaps team viewer.&nbsp;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also want to consider using virtual machines for an additional layer of security. If you have to download a program for other purposes and are not particularly comfortable doing so on your main machine, spinning up a ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù VM could help protect against unknown threats</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I use a hardware wallet for my cold storage option for 90% of my funds. I have also set this up with a 2 of 3 shemir backup. You can read more about this backup method in my telegram</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider/920"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">post here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I will store those 3 separate seeds in 3 separate locations.&nbsp;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Always</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> secure exchange accounts with 2FA. </span><b>Never</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use sim based 2FA (because of</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/11/26/sim-swap-scam-what-it-is-how-protect-yourself/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sim-swap attacks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). While I do use authenticator apps for some 2FA logins, I purchased a</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">security key</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a few months ago. There are many exchanges that support these security keys including Binance for example</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of security keys, these can also be used to secure other sensitive accounts that require 2FA including email accounts. For those that remember our</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1406301419330809858"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google account issue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about a month ago, a simple security key could have solved that.&nbsp;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to avoid reusing addresses when possible. This is not only suboptimal for your own privacy but it also impacts on the security of the broader Bitcoin network. I do know that generating a new address for all transactions is sometimes impractical so it is about striking a balance of course. That balance needs to be determined by yourself.&nbsp;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a VPN whenever possible. It‚Äôs much more prudent to cloak your home IP address when interacting with an open and permissionless network such as a cryptocurrency‚Äôs blockchain.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are some of the most important tips that I have for you at the moment. Of course, I must stress that I would not prescribe it for everyone - it is just what I personally do.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîí </span><b>Level Up Your Crypto Security: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I have already shared some of my top security tips, There is a much simpler way to secure your crypto - and that is a hardware wallet.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But are they worth it and which one should you get? Well, I have already done a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t3Brlb0qzQ&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dedicated video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on that - so, be sure to check that out if you want to learn more!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, some of you may not have all the time to watch the video. So, I don‚Äôt mind telling you that the hardware wallet I personally use is a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/trezor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor One!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It supports over 1,000 different cryptocurrencies. So, I imagine that even the most avid altcoin dabbler will be able to store the crypto that they want here!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ü•ä </span><b>Punchy Crypto Asset: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs no secret that some people made a killing by snapping up hot .com domains back in the 1990‚Äôs. How much did some of these guys make? Well, Business.com was sold for a mindbogging $345 million - a tidy chunk of change indeed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Needless to say, I missed the boat on that one and I bet most of you did too. However, there is potentially another similar opportunity with blockchain domains! Those domains are issued as an NFT. You could host a website on it and replace your crypto address with a human readable name too.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you are looking to diversify your NFT portfolio into the more exotic end of the crypto markets, then blockchain domains could be right up your street. I actually did a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO3yqHQyc8E&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comprehensive video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all about the ins and outs of blockchain domains.&nbsp;</span>

		<Title>October 3, 2021 - Mindblowing Crypto Project!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not often that I come across a crypto project that really blows my mind, but Helium is one such example.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was about 2 weeks ago when I decided to take a deeper dive into the project. This was thanks to many of my viewers suggesting I look into it - so thanks if that‚Äôs you!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason that I found this project so fascinating is because of how big its ambitions are. It wants to completely reshape the way we think about wireless networks. It‚Äôs also intriguing as unlike most cryptocurrency projects, the underlying tech was not developed with crypto in mind.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather, it was developed from the ground up to help decentralise 5G networks. It was only when they were thinking of ways to encourage participation did they consider the economic benefits that come from a cryptocurrency.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That crypto is HNT and it‚Äôs got some pretty unique tokenomics‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I don‚Äôt want to give the game away, but I really enjoyed researching this project. That rabbit hole goes deep but I hope my latest video shines some light on it for you guys!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/n1FUV4YsXcc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.</span></a>


<b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Few small changes to the portfolio. Sold off a bit of my SOL and PAXG to put into DOT. Just a bit of rebalancing in my smart contract plays. Moreover, I still think DOT is undervalued especially given that we could have PLOs coming soon. I will be doing an updated video on Polkadot so keep an eye out for that.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of other coins on my radar, I am still considering HNT and may pick up a bit more AR if the price allows it. I will keep you guys updated in my NOW VERIFIED! </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 25.84% | BTC 21.59% | SOL 15.39% | DOT 9.24% | USDC 4.66% | ADA 4.33% | PAXG 4.29% | ATOM 4.27% | UST 2.82% | RUNE 2.01% | INJ 1.81% | AR 1.32% | LINK 1.15% | MATIC 1.09% | LIT 0.18%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I bet you‚Äôre all wondering why the crypto market suddenly rallied late last week. I was pretty stumped myself, but I seem to have put my finger on a few factors which could have caused it. For starters we have </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/574842-no-deal-house-delays-infrastructure-vote"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the delay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the infrastructure bill which contains those two crypto clauses that could be harmful to crypto. The TLDR there is that it will require ill defined ‚Äòbrokers‚Äô to collect KYC on customers and require the counterparty in any transaction worth more than $10, 000 to be reported to the IRS (tax man).¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The delay of the infrastructure bill also explains why the stock market continued to crash even as the crypto market pumped. As we have seen over the past year, the two have generally been following each other as traders rebalance risk-on and risk-off positions.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case though, what was good for crypto was bad for the market, because the infrastructure bill would inject 1.5 trillion into the economy, and some of that money would have a ripple effect in the regular stock market. Because that spending has been delayed, stocks continue to suffer (though they have recovered a tad).¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The second factor which could have contributed to the recent rally was SEC Chairman Gary Gensler‚Äôs </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/gary-gensler-sec-review-of-bitcoin-futures-etf-applications-2021-9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reiteration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that he is ‚Äúlooking forward to the SEC‚Äôs review‚Äù of Bitcoin futures ETF filings. On Friday, the SEC again </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-extends-four-bitcoin-etf-deadlines-by-45-days"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delayed their decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 4 Bitcoin ETFs into late November and early December. Oddly enough, this is a pretty good sign, because if they weren‚Äôt on board with any of these Bitcoin ETFs they would have rejected them outright.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The third factor that probably played a role in the recent pump was the low balance of BTC on exchanges. As I‚Äôve mentioned many times before, this makes it much easier to move BTC‚Äôs price up or down, and what we saw on Friday was very much a BTC driven move.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/01/coinbase-premium-indicates-whales-on-binance-may-be-behind-bitcoins-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on-chain data suggests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> most of this investment was coming from outside of the United States. I have a feeling that a lot of this money came from Dubai, because regulators</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/uae-regulators-approve-crypto-trading-in-dubai-free-zone"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently sanctioned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crypto trading there. In case you missed the memo, there are a lot of rich people in Dubai.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As amazing as the crypto market is looking right now though, it‚Äôs important to remember that we‚Äôre not out of the woods just yet. The current US administration is looking to bring stablecoins under the wings of </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/biden-admin-weighing-bank-like-regulation-for-stablecoin-issuers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banking regulators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and this is something I‚Äôve been warning you all about for a while.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The details are still up in the air though and nothing has been passed yet, so that‚Äôs probably why the crypto market hasn‚Äôt reacted. Even so, this could get really ugly really fast, which is why I‚Äôm glad Terra </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://decrypt.co/82354/terras-columbus-5-upgrade-sees-luna-surge-by-10"><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully shipped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their Columbus 5 upgrade.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This will make it easy to bring their decentralized UST stablecoin to every cryptocurrency blockchain. As you can see from the above, I hold some UST in my personal portfolio and think that it is a good idea to diversify stablecoin risk away from just the centralised versions. You can get my most recent take on Terra </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/uLmVtec0px4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ü§î </span><b>Polkadot ü§î</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">September was quite the month for smart contract chains. These include the likes of Solana, Algorand and Cardano. However, one of those projects which did not seem to get as much fanfare was Polkadot.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I have a feeling that the final quarter could be Polkadot‚Äôs time to shine. And that is all because of those upcoming Parachain Loan Offerings. These could be imminent and Gavin Wood recently disclosed that they were </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/gavin-wood-says-parachains-virtually-ready-to-launch-on-polkadot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ready to launch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. No timeline was given, but once the audit was complete it could be announced.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When that happens, there could be a flood of projects from the Kusama ecosystem that are likely to want to move over to Polkadot. In fact, according to a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://polkadot.network/blog/making-history-an-overview-of-the-first-five-parachain-slot-auctions-on-kusama/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 80% of the prospective Kusama parachain projects planned to launch on Polkadot too.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If I was a betting man, I would say that any Polkadot Parachain launch would have to wait until Kusama is done with their second set of parachain slot auctions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once these Polkadot PLOs start, there are already quite a lot of exciting projects that could are ready to roll. One of these is Acala which is set to become the DeFi hub of the Polkadot ecosystem - a project I have had my eyes on for </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/KzqLf7Kteuk?t=406"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some time now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the individual projects that are building here, the launch of PLOs could been a boon for the price of DOT. This is for three reasons:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will create hype around the Polkadot ecosystem and all the media coverage / FOMO that comes with it</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be demand to stake DOT in order to participate in these PLOs</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they are staked, they are taking out of supply and hence means less is available to go around</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these factors are price positive for DOT.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also a number of upgrades which are being planned for Polkadot - upgrades which could further decentralise the project and hence make it less susceptible to regulatory pressure points.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot more that I want to talk about with Polkadot and I will be covering it in an upcoming video - so stay tuned!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Newbie Tips üîù</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In last week‚Äôs mailer I gave you all some security tips. There‚Äôs one I missed that‚Äôs especially relevant given recent events. I‚Äôm referring to the revelation that over 6000 Coinbase users were hacked earlier this year, and as </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-exploit-mfa-flaw-to-steal-from-6-000-coinbase-customers-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinTelegraph reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äúthe attackers must have known the affected users‚Äô email address, password and phone number‚Äù.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, but the overwhelming majority of hacks happen because people use the same email and password combination on multiple sites, at least according to </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWvHcoqru7I"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this guy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a must watch interview by the way). While your login info may be safe on larger sites like Facebook and Twitter, this is not the case for smaller websites because they don‚Äôt have nearly the same degree of cybersecurity tech.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When smaller websites get hacked, the hackers use various programs which automatically enter the email and password combinations they scraped into hundreds of other sites until they get a hit, and that might be how the Coinbase hack happened. It‚Äôs also not beyond the realm of possibility that a rogue employee could have leaked it¬† - we just don‚Äôt know.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is, humans are corruptible, and there‚Äôs no amount of regulation that can change that. Add this to the list of reasons to keep your crypto in your own self custodial wallet. You can get my top recommendations for crypto wallets </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/_t3Brlb0qzQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/_ZZov-0Qvr8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing I mentioned in last week‚Äôs security tips was a few ways you can protect your privacy. One thing you should keep in mind at all times is that blockchain tracking firms like Chainalysis </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/21/leaked-slides-show-how-chainalysis-flags-crypto-suspects-for-cops/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can easily track you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down, especially if you‚Äôve ever interacted with a centralized exchange (and I‚Äôm sure almost all of you have).¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I say this because Compound Finance founder Robert Leshner </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://decrypt.co/82387/defi-community-blasts-compound-ceo-for-doxxed-comment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not so subtly threatened </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">recipients of additional COMP rewards to return them or else be reported to the IRS (as they are ‚Äúdoxxed‚Äù. As you can imagine, his tweet went down like a lead balloon and drew the ire of many in the crypto community.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, here‚Äôs the thing. Compound Finance does not do KYC on its users (how can they?). But his tweet underscores an important point and that is that these blockchain firms can easily Dox anyone if determined enough.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And speaking of those additional COMP rewards, if you happen to be one of those lucky recipients, you should know that they are very much yours to keep. In crypto all transactions are final for better or for worse. That said, be aware of the tax implications something like this could have, and remember not to take tax advice (or threats) from anyone who‚Äôs not a licensed accountant.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto taxes are a hot topic right now especially since governments are starving for money, and they know where the money is at. Consider getting your hands on a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/kwBfgYIl-ww"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto tax software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, see if you can </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://youtu.be/EMNSwa_PkkA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce your crypto tax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> burden, or even consider moving to a </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omGrsqi7nrQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto friendly country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you‚Äôve made massive gains.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üí∂ </span><b>Buy Crypto With Fiat: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto markets have kicked off with a bang this month. Maybe you feel that now is the time to top up that crypto portfolio? The truth is that buying crypto can be a huge learning curve for many people and that‚Äôs why there is value in exchanges that are super easy to use.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most user-friendly exchange I have found is the </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/swissborg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swissborg app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I actually use this myself to move in and out of the crypto and fiat. What‚Äôs incredible is that I have had </span><b>crypto withdrawals hit my bank account instantly</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - something you don‚Äôt see often.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Swissborg offers you access to dozens of major cryptos and a few exotic players too. On top of that, it is the </span><b>easiest way to earn crypto interest.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Here you can </span><b>earn crypto yield up to 8.94%</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in just a few clicks - that means no messing around with complicated DeFi yield farming.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, if you deposit ‚Ç¨50+ on Swissborg, then you‚Äôll get up to </span><b>‚Ç¨100 FREE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in CHSB tokens. You‚Äôll probably want to take advantage of that!</span>

<b>ü¶æ Trading Automation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those crypto markets are surging at all hours of the day, that brings with it a plethora of trading opportunities. However, there are two main problems:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">1) Most people simply have no idea if their trading strategy is any good. Rather than trading blindly, you can </span><b>stack the odds in your favour</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by </span><b>backtesting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your strategy against historical price data. If that strategy you are using did well over the past year, then that‚Äôs a great indication that your strategy could be worth using today.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2) Often, profitable opportunities pop up whilst you are asleep or out and about. However, trading bots allow you to </span><b>automate your trading strategies </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and take advantage of those markets 24/7.¬†¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do these sound like problems you face? Well, you are going to want to look into </span><b>crypto trading tools</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">! I‚Äôve </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye3nUsbegGI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">done a video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all about them which tells you all you need to know!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don‚Äôt have the time to watch that, then I don‚Äôt mind telling you that I personally use </span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/3commas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3Commas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as my crypto trading bot of choice.¬†</span>

		<Title>October 10, 2021 - This is the WORST Case for Crypto!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I‚Äôm fully committed to the crypto space, I have sometimes asked myself what the worst case for crypto is. That‚Äôs important as knowing the maximum downside possible can help inform broader investment decisions.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, can crypto really ever be ‚Äúbanned‚Äù? Or is there a chance that it could go to zero?¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, I explore the topic in an in-depth video. I analyse some of the most well known risks we see today - everything from new legislation to security flaws, from a Tether collapse to regulatory overreach.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I also break down some of the cryptocurrencies and protocols that could be at greatest risk from these potential threats.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I know it's not the most pleasant topic, but it still needs to be analysed.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/EqsTuaLRGuk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.¬†</span></a>


<b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Took a little bit more profit on SOL given that it was making up a large percentage of my portfolio. I also eventually decided to pick up some HNT. For those of you who watched </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1FUV4YsXcc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week on Helium, you will have seen that I was really bullish on the project. This was bought partly through some of the funds from SOL sale as well as some of my USDC pile.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few other altcoins that I am considering but I will let you know about in my Telegram channel - Now officially VERIFIED! ‚úÖ Here is a snapshot of the updated portfolio:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 26.25% | BTC 24.18% | SOL 11.95% | DOT 10.04% | PAXG 4.19% | ADA 4.14% | USDC 3.95% | ATOM 3.62% | UST 2.74% | INJ 1.93% | RUNE 1.79% | HNT 1.69% | AR 1.37% | LINK 1.1% | MATIC 1.05%¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC is up almost 10k since last week‚Äôs newsletter. That‚Äôs pretty crazy, but in retrospect it was clearly visible on the charts. Pop open BTC/USDT or whatever your preferred trading pair is and set it to daily.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Notice how it rallied up from 40k to 48k, paused, and kept going? This is a very common bullish pattern called </span><a href="https://youtu.be/9_Bs5R66NxY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bull flag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or as I like to call it, a topless P).¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We seem to be seeing the same pattern forming again albeit slightly more drawn out. If it plays out, we could rally back up to 64k. This time around we will have way more room to the upside though, because </span><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=cryptocurrency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Search Trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. are still pretty stagnant. What this means is that the retail FOMO hasn‚Äôt really come in yet.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As reported by CoinTelegraph, CoinDesk, and other crypto news, the rally we saw last week was driven primarily by institutional investors </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/06/bitcoin-futures-premium-on-cme-surges-as-etf-speculation-grips-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">speculating </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that a Bitcoin ETF approval could be just around the corner. This is a bit strange though, because the SEC recently announced they </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-extends-four-bitcoin-etf-deadlines-by-45-days"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had delayed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a series of Bitcoin ETF applications until November and December.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, when the Bitcoin ETF comes (and it will come eventually), it could mark the top of this crypto market cycle the same way that the introduction of the CME Bitcoin futures during the last bull market. One thing to keep in mind there is that the announcement of the CME Bitcoin futures didn‚Äôt mark the top. It was the day those futures </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/17/worlds-largest-futures-exchange-set-to-launch-bitcoin-futures-sunday-night.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">actually began trading</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Bitcoin is in the spotlight right now and probably will be for a while, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before investors get bored with BTC and go looking for bigger gains with altcoins. When that happens we will see an altcoin season unlike any other. As such, if there are any altcoins you‚Äôve been looking to get your hands on, now might be a good time (not financial advice!).¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üßê </span><b>Latest Tether FUD üßê</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tether is once again back in the spotlight. This time it is due to an </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigative piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Bloomberg. I wouldn‚Äôt dismiss it outright as it was a really interesting read. There were also some pieces in there that we hadn‚Äôt originally known about Tether.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here were some of the main highlights:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tether Loaned Celsius $1bn USDT in exchange for Bitcoin as collateral. This would mean that some of the reserves are loans from Celsius</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial Paper: Tether has a lot of it. If correct, it would make Tether the 7th largest holder of such debt. There is no breakdown of what this commercial paper is but according to a document seen by the journalist, it includes billions in Chinese company debt. This is something I talked about in my </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5g46Nk4PuM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evergrande video.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†¬†</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A previous banker of Tether said that the company had put reserves at risk by investing as if it were a ‚Äúhedge fund‚Äù</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tether‚Äôs main bank in the Bahamas no longer holds the bulk of the assets. They only retain about $15 billion</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, these are indeed legitimate concerns that once again raise the question of whether Tether is 100% backed by reserves. It once again raises the spectre of whether Tether could be at risk in a modern day ‚Äúrun on the bank‚Äù.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That all being said - Tether remains operating. There has never been an occasion during which they have denied a redemption request from a client. Large crypto companies from exchanges to lending platforms and the like routinely redeem billions. I find it hard to believe that these individuals would be confident using USDT if they had these suspicions.¬†</span>

<a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/celsius/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-25574 size-full" src="https://cbtestw.kinsta.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/celsius_inline.jpg" alt="Celsius Inline" width="1000" height="360" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Tether has settled their case with the New York DA. I can‚Äôt imagine the DA would have allowed them to settle if they could find any evidence of reserves not actually being present.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, not that I am a fan about whataboutism, but let‚Äôs not forget that banks in the US </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1446447826049900545?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are not required to hold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> any reserves at all for their outstanding loans.¬†¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, should we be worried about Tether?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, yes. But not because of it being illiquid. The main risks for Tether are what regulators have planned.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems pretty clear that the current administration would like </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-seeks-to-regulate-stablecoin-issuers-as-banks-11633103156"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to regulate stablecoins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like banks. There are only certain companies in the stablecoin space that would be able to do this and those would be the onshore US based ones (USDC, Paxos etc).¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was also disclosed this week that USDC </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-05/crypto-firm-circle-says-it-got-subpoena-from-u-s-sec-in-july"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received a subpoena</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the SEC and that they are cooperating with them. And, just two days ago it was reported that the White House was considering a wide ranging </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-08/white-house-weighs-wide-ranging-push-for-crypto-oversight"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on cryptocurrencies - one that you can be certain will be targeted at stablecoin issuers.¬†¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If US regulators require exchanges to only use US registered stablecoins, it could severely damage the liquidity of offshore stablecoin issuers such as Tether. Any restrictive regulation could actually precipitate the redemption crisis that many fear.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I‚Äôm less concerned about the FUD coming from the media outlets and more concerned about the actual statements coming from US regulators. It is for this reason that I don‚Äôt hold USDT as a stable store of value in my portfolio.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Newbie Tips üîù</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I know the crypto market is looking pretty good right now, but don‚Äôt get caught up in the hype just yet. There are still a lot of risks for the crypto market (as mentioned above). The average crypto investor seems to be ignoring these risks as evidenced by the sudden increase in </span><a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">market greed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, where there is greed, there are meme coins. I‚Äôve lost count of the number of meme coins being showcased by CoinMarketCap. One of these is Shiba Inu, which a lot of people are asking about again. As I mentioned </span><a href="https://youtu.be/r-a8YeIVpzA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about SHIB, it will never reach a dollar, much less a cent, because then it would have a larger market cap than Bitcoin.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre wondering why SHIB is pumping, it‚Äôs for the same reason that every meme coin pumps: price manipulation. In this case, that‚Äôs an </span><a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/shiba-inu-whale-buys-6-3-trillion-shib-tokens-2565889#:~:text=An%20anonymous%20buyer%20decided%20to,27%2C81%2C19%2C505)."><span style="font-weight: 400;">anonymous whale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buying up more than 50 million dollars in SHIB within a span of a few days, causing everyone to FOMO in which kept the hype train going. Again, this is the case with almost every meme coin you see, so please, be careful.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides meme coins, the other thing you need to be on the lookout for these days is crypto scams. I‚Äôve been doing my best to delete comments from scammers across my social media platforms, but even a combination of me + my team + a scam/spam comment bots aren‚Äôt enough to fight them all off, and a few of you are still getting hurt on a daily basis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully I‚Äôm verified everywhere except Instagram which should minimise the damage, but I know there will still be a few outliers because crypto scammers can be really convincing. Pro tip: watch my video </span><a href="https://youtu.be/AFhSf0l_aQQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about crypto scams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so you know what to look out for.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Better yet, share this video with any friends who are new to crypto and tell them to watch it before they dare to put a dime into any old shitcoin.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span>

<b>üìà Top Crypto Exchange: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those crypto markets have sure been soaring over the past week. Maybe you feel that you need to top up your portfolio and get your altcoin positions set for the next epic run? To do that, you‚Äôre going to need a top-notch crypto exchange.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But which one do you choose?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, you‚Äôll need access to an exchange with a plethora of different </span><b>exotic altcoins</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>super low fees </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">- that way you help maximise your gains.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The exchange I am using to get all that is </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/kucoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kucoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where you have access to hundreds of different altcoins. On top of that, I‚Äôve even got you a special deal over there. This gives you a </span><b>trading fee discount of up to 60%!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to learn more about the ins and outs of this exchange? Well, you‚Äôll want to watch my </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHKYxgxDCO4&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dedicated Kucoin video.</span></a>

<b>üìä Automate Portfolio Rebalancing: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it is super exciting to see your portfolio growing and racking up insane gains. However, the truth is that a good chunk of that overall performance could be down to an altcoin or two exploding. This can leave your portfolio overexposed to a single project.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what is the solution?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, if you have the time you could manually rebalance that portfolio every couple of days. Or you could automate that entire process using a tool like </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/shrimpy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shrimpy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you might want to check that out if you want to save some time here. On top of that, I‚Äôve also secured you an </span><b>exclusive 30% discount</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Shrimpy subscriptions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, instead of claiming that ad money, I thought it would be better to open up </span><a href="https://store.coinbureau.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my merch store</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and give you guys the option of supporting the channel over there instead.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week I have added three new products to the store:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>One for the ladies:</b> <a href="https://store.coinbureau.com/product/btc-multicolour-circle-black-t-shirt-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC Multicolour circle t-shirt</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>For the Bitcoin fans:</b> <a href="https://store.coinbureau.com/product/btc-word-game-black-sweatshirt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC Word Game sweatshirt!</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>For ETH lovers:</b> <a href="https://store.coinbureau.com/product/eth-word-game-black-sweatshirt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH Word Game sweatshirt</span></a></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All sales from the store help me keep producing content on the channel and keep it completely ad free for everyone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks in advance for your support here!</span>

		<Title>October 18, 2021 - The CRAZIEST Thing I have Read!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôm sure that you are all incredibly focused on that ETF news. It‚Äôs doubtlessly a watershed moment for Bitcoin and it‚Äôs my hope that it will supercharge adoption in the years to come.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the SEC approval of an ETF was bound to happen. You only need take a look at the increasing bullish sentiment that is coming out of financial institutions. One of these was the likes of Bank of America which recently initiated their cryptocurrency research due to ‚Äúincreasing institutional demand‚Äù.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To kick off their coverage, they released one of the most comprehensive research reports I have seen to date. Entitled ‚ÄúDigital Assets Primer: Only the first inning‚Äù, this report is a literal treasure trove of information. Everything from Bitcoin to NFTs, Defi to CBDCs and more.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is only one slight problem though‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs over </span><b>140 pages</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> long!</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here! In my video today, I break down this behemoth of a report into its most important sections. I analyse what they mean and add my own commentary and thoughts.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you guys really want to see what the institutions have planned, this is a video you don‚Äôt want to miss!</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it here</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Took a bit of profit on my BTC position and I put this into UST. Apart from that, there were no other changes made this week.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, I may add more to my DOT position. This is mainly because of the fact that we now have a defined timeline </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/13/polkadot-sets-date-for-hotly-anticipated-parachain-auctions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the launch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Polkadot Parachains. As I predicted in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY4Sfti5HmA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week about the imminent launch of these, it could drive a great deal of demand for DOT.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, I also have to disclose that I have been sent an </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1448392253303664643?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">honourary NFT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As you guys know, I have recently been exploring the NFT space and a project team decided to mint a Guy spacepunk for me!</span></p>

<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you believe me if I told you that what we‚Äôve seen this week is just the beginning? If not, pull up the BTC chart on the monthly.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call me crazy, but I see a </span><a href="https://youtu.be/9_Bs5R66NxY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">massive bull flag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If my measurements are correct, we could hit 100k by the end of the year. There is no guarantee this will happen of course, but the chances are looking pretty good, especially with the approval of those Bitcoin ETFs. More on that below. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides current events, there are many macro factors that are taking Bitcoin higher, primarily inflation. Last week we got the latest retail and wholesale inflation numbers for the United States, and I suppose they‚Äôre not all that surprising. Retail inflation is </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/the-consumer-price-index-rose-5point4percent-year-over-year-in-september-vs-5point3percent-estimate.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up to 5.4%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to the CPI, a 0.4% annualised increase compared to the month before. Wholesale inflation on the other hand is up to a </span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/10/14/us-wholesale-inflation-surges-to-another-record"><span style="font-weight: 400;">staggering 8.6%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the highest it‚Äôs been since 2010.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although some of this inflation is coming from supply chain issues, inflation was already surging before these supply chain issues came around. This suggests the real culprit is central bank money printing.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As basic economics dictates, the more of something there is, the less it‚Äôs worth; prices aren‚Äôt actually rising, fiat currencies are losing value. This is why so many institutional investors are </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/10/08/bitcoin-not-gold-is-the-new-inflation-hedge-says-jp-morgan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turning to Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to protect their purchasing power.¬†</span></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/pk1MyzlhBJk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On chain indicators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support this narrative as well. I‚Äôve been watching the percentage of BTC held by whales like a hawk, along with the percentage of BTC on exchanges. Contrary to the price action we saw earlier this year, whales are continuing to accumulate BTC, and the percentage of BTC on exchanges continues to fall.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means they‚Äôre HODLing, not selling, and this means we have a clear runway for new all time highs in the coming weeks.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here‚Äôs the craziest part of all of this price action: nobody is paying attention. Seriously, check out the </span><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=cryptocurrency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Search Trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. They‚Äôre all completely flat.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means the retail FOMO has yet to arrive, and that means we could have a lot more room to the upside this time around for both BTC and altcoins. On that note, make sure to watch</span><a href="https://youtu.be/alZd-mk-19Q"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that you don‚Äôt get rekt if and when you decide to start selling. You can thank me later!¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üëÄ </span><b>Bitcoin ETF Watch üëÄ</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all heard by now, it looks like we‚Äôre going to see two futures backed Bitcoin ETF begin trading next week. Both of these were approved by the SEC on Friday, and the lucky winners were </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-proshares-follows-valkyrie-in-approval-for-listing-bitcoin-strategy-etf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valkyrie and ProShares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former will be trading on the NASDAQ, and the latter will be trading on the New York Stock Exchange‚Äôs Arca platform. Trading may begin as early as Monday or Tuesday, though this has yet to be officially confirmed.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As highlighted by the aforementioned </span><a href="https://research1.ml.com/Archive/12332274R1.pdf?q=gEeoeEFRwBjXYhK2jpu31qD231lcjBCf2GrnDeMYk!I&amp;__gda__=1634370569_261d2f9707cbe2a99ceb81fb51aac1e6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank of America report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are currently 20 ETF applications sitting with the SEC. This leaves 19, because Ark Invest recently filed for a futures backed Bitcoin ETF with the SEC as well. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas earlier implied that this new ETF by Ark Invest could also be approved, given that it was </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-tickers-and-ark-filing-shows-bitcoin-futures-etf-approval-imminent-analyst"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assigned a ticker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the Valkyrie ETF (which was just approved).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJE6-mrjnqk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about futures backed Bitcoin ETFs, the approval of these kinds of ETFs won‚Äôt have a direct effect on the price of Bitcoin. This is because futures backed Bitcoin ETFs are not backed by physical Bitcoin. They‚Äôre basically backed by IOU paper trades on the CME futures exchange.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These don‚Äôt always reflect the price of Bitcoin properly, can have high management fees, and also lack liquidity which can lead to additional volatility.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that the price action we‚Äôre seeing now is mostly because of the hype associated with the futures backed Bitcoin ETF approvals, and I reckon that hype is quite warranted. Although a futures backed Bitcoin ETF isn‚Äôt ideal, it‚Äôs one small step towards a physically backed Bitcoin ETF which would have a profound effect on the price of BTC. If you don‚Äôt understand why, be sure to watch</span><a href="https://youtu.be/o3-j0JTTJYE"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> my older video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Bitcoin ETFs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">P.S. I‚Äôve mentioned many times that the launch of a Bitcoin ETF could signal the top of the current bull market. However, the launch of a futures backed Bitcoin ETF is probably not a top signal.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned earlier, the on-chain metrics, social metrics, and even technical analysis are all flashing bullish. I reckon the approval of a physically backed Bitcoin ETF will be the top, and we probably won‚Äôt see it until the banks are done setting up their crypto custody solutions. More on that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/uPBR3mn6wKU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üá®üá≥ ‚Äú</span><b>Ban Bitcoin‚Äù FUD üá®üá≥</b></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you guys have been following my channel for more than 6 months, you will have heard me cover the Chinese mining crackdown a number of times. Back in May, when the Chinese government first announced that they would be banning mining, FUD filled the air.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News headlines like </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57169726"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/21/bitcoin-falls-as-china-calls-for-crackdown-on-crypto-mining-trading/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were plastered everywhere. The price of Bitcoin was falling at its fastest pace since the pandemic crash of last year. Hashpower was also collapsing as those Chinese miners had to cease operations.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, however, </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/976"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I explained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> why I thought it was one of the most bullish events for Bitcoin network security in the long term. It would lead to a mass exodus of these Chinese miners to jurisdictions that were more friendly to them.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, the more important point is that it would further distribute and decentralise that Mining power throughout the world. It would help to neutralise the argument that is often used of Bitcoin being ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù by Chinese miners.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, a few days ago, the folks over at Cambridge </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1448626148045475840?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released statistics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the mining landscape. It showed that China‚Äôs share of global hashrate went from 44% in May to 0 in July. It‚Äôs hard to imagine this given that only two years ago, the country accounted for a full 75% of hashpower.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is this development great for the further decentralisation of the Bitcoin network, but it also means that worries emanating from China are less likely to impact the price of Bitcoin. ‚ÄúChina bans‚Äù bitcoin FUD won‚Äôt really have any impact on the price if there was no Bitcoin to ban in the first place.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another reason as to why the </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58678907"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most recent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chinese ban on cryptocurrency transactions is long term bullish. It will reduce the impact of similar FUD in the future and it will reduce general volatility.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of all of this, the episode is further testament to how resilient the cryptocurrency is - the ‚Äúhoney badger‚Äù of money. If it can survive a large-scale crackdown by one of the most powerful nations on earth, it can survive anything.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the Biden </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-embarking-on-aggressive-tack-for-cryptocurrency-white-house-official-says-11634077058"><span style="font-weight: 400;">administration is looking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to tightly regulate cryptocurrency. Yes, Congress is trying to </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/explainer-how-cryptocurrency-fits-into-infrastructure-bill"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pass legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that could crimp innovation. Yes, the SEC is dying to bring cryptocurrency enforcement into its purview. But none of these things present challenges as threatening as an authoritarian country unilaterally banning all cryptocurrency overnight.</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in an era of cancel culture, Bitcoin is the only thing that cannot be cancelled...¬†¬†</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what one to go for?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I imagine most of you will want access to a wide selection of altcoins, rock bottom trading fees, fiat deposits and withdrawals and all those bells and whistles. Well, there is an exchange I am using at the moment that ticks all those boxes.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would be </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/ftx/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve heard via the grapevine that some of my merch is a little outlandish and in your face. On top of that, I‚Äôve apparently not been doing a good enough job on my ladies merch line either. So, I‚Äôve been working tirelessly to solve that problem and create some more conservative crypto merch.</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That has led to the creation of the </span><b>Coin Bureau Basic‚Äôs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> product line! Here I have begun launching t-shirts and sweatshirts for the more conservative Coin Bureau fans out there! On top of that, I‚Äôve just added an exclusive ladies T-shirt to the store too!</span></p>

		<Title>October 25, 2021 - BIG Hidden Risk For Bitcoin?!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, the crypto markets are not isolated from the broader economy. And, right now, one of the biggest risks we face going into winter is an energy crisis.</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global energy prices are skyrocketing faster than a hopium filled sh!tcoin. Not only that, but given the lack of available energy supply, there is a legitimate concern that power may have to be rationed.</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does this have to do with Bitcoin?</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, miners are competing for all that energy that is now in short supply. Miners who are already facing increasing costs on account of competition and the aforementioned energy prices.</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even if these miners could fit the bill for sky high electricity costs, they would be the last in line if there ever was a situation in which energy had to be rationed. Public perception is not on their side.</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is exactly what I explore in my video today. The hidden risks of reliance on a fragile global electricity supply chain. Of course, with every risk comes opportunity and I cover that as well.</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/rex-h4vkELs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.</span></a></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Took a bit of profit on my ETH, BTC, SOL &amp; ADA. Will be keeping half of this in USDC as dry powder but am going to use some to pick up some DOT &amp; RUNE.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned last week, DOT is exciting because of those upcoming PLOs and the demand they could drive for DOT. When it comes to RUNE, Thorchain is finally back online and I am quite optimistic about its potential to transform cross-chain DeFi liquidity. I will be doing a ThorChain update video so keep your eyes peeled for that!</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My updated portfolio is the following:¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 26.00% | BTC 22.10% | SOL 12.18% | DOT 11.24% | USDC 5.56% | PAXG 3.85% | ATOM 3.26% | UST 3.15% | RUNE 3.07% | ADA 2.82% | INJ 1.86% | HNT 1.62% | MATIC 1.13% |¬† LINK 1.10% | AR 1.06%</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In last week‚Äôs </span><a href="https://youtu.be/bkuxVnr41Uw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I predicted that Bitcoin would hit 67k before correcting, and it looks like I was right! Right now we appear to be holding strong around the 61k mark, but I do think we will drift down to 54-55k.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because the last week of the month tends to be the most bearish for Bitcoin due to options expiries. As I have mentioned before, these expiry days impact the spot market due to a combination of whale manipulation and market maker rebalancing.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving over to Ethereum though, the price is painting a different picture. It looks like ETH is forming a bull flag that‚Äôs scheduled to break later this week, and this happens to coincide with Ethereum‚Äôs upcoming Altair upgrade which is scheduled for October 27th (Wednesday). It‚Äôs worth pointing out that this upgrade isn‚Äôt for Ethereum 1.0, but for </span><a href="https://youtu.be/NNa7bWQsC4M"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum 2.0</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ethereum developer </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/84176/ethereum-altair-upgrade-next-week-heres-whats-in-it"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim Beiko</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ethereum‚Äôs Altair upgrade will do the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make it possible for validators on the Beacon chain to run light nodes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase slashing penalties for stakers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepare the Beacon Chain for the merge with Ethereum which will transition its blockchain from proof of work to proof of stake. This merge is currently scheduled to happen early next year.¬†</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But back to ETH‚Äôs price though. It looks like the hype around Altair could push ETH up to around 4700$, or at least that‚Äôs what the aforementioned bull flag suggests. The crypto market winds are blowing in the right direction too as Bitcoin dominance declines. This means money is moving into altcoins, and that means it‚Äôs the perfect time to construct your </span><a href="https://youtu.be/ZGd6O79_MOc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimate altcoin exit strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs time to sell. Besides the fact that I don‚Äôt give financial advice, there are multiple signs which suggest we‚Äôre on the cusp of another epic rally. Most of these signs can be seen </span><a href="https://youtu.be/pk1MyzlhBJk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on chain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the two most relevant that come to mind are the percentage of BTC on exchanges and the percentage of BTC held by whales (those with 1-10k BTC).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to exchange balances of BTC, these have been dropping like a rock despite the new all time highs we saw last week.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What this means is that people aren‚Äôt selling the new highs - they‚Äôre HODLing. As for the BTC whales, they‚Äôre continuing to accumulate, albeit at a slower pace than they did in the past. Keep a close eye on </span><a href="https://youtu.be/XSJnX9oe_is"><span style="font-weight: 400;">what they do</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because they have the power to move the crypto market.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, speaking of those whales, there is one investor class that has so far been ignored but could radically alter the crypto markets..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üí∞ </span><b>Interesting New Trend üí∞</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I have long been covering the adoption of Bitcoin by traditional financial institutions like Banks, Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds, there is one investor class that has remained on the sidelines.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that was pension funds‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why is because these funds are tasked with a very important goal of preserving capital for people‚Äôs retirement. Hence, they would only really be investing in assets they are certain could preserve the future value of these retirement savings. Their asset allocation is generally to more ‚Äúsafe‚Äù investments such as bonds, blue chip equities etc.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, ever since the past few months, an increasing number of Pension Funds have been allocating funds to Bitcoin &amp; Cryptocurrencies. Here is a list of some of the most recent examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, a </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/virginia-public-pensions-make-a-direct-bet-on-cryptocurrencies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">couple of Pension</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funds have been investing in crypto funds. These include funds such as Morgan Creek Asset Management, Blockchain Capital &amp; Parataxis Capital Management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada‚Äôs second largest pension fund, CDPQ (with $300bn AuM), </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/30854926-f9ca-4352-b17e-7e464b6a3a3d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently co-led</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Celsius funding round. Celsius is perhaps one of the largest crypto lending platforms on the market. I should also note that this is despite the regulatory scrutiny lending services are under.¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Australia‚Äôs largest Pension funds, QIC (with $69bn AuM), </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d7f1000b-1022-4bac-bb88-a112f0c1c263"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the financial times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they are open to investing in cryptocurrencies in the future.¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Houston Pension fund for city Firefighters </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/houston-pension-buys-crypto-an-asset-we-could-not-ignore"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has invested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Bitcoin and Ethereum through the NYDIG. What was so interesting about this was the fact that they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want synthetic exposure‚Äù. Their CIO also said ‚ÄúWe decided to go directly to the token. As more and more institutional adoptions happen, there will be more and more dynamics that develop for supply and demand. And having physical assets -- actual tokens -- gives us in the future the possibility of income generation potential‚Äù</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are only some of the most recent examples out there and I am sure that you will find many more cases of private and government pension funds dipping their toes into crypto.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why is this important?¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, because Pension funds are some of the largest asset managers in the world. The total AuM of global pension funds stands at an eye-watering </span><a href="https://www.oecd.org/finance/private-pensions/Pension-Funds-in-Figures-2021.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$35 Trillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If even a small fraction of this made its way into cryptocurrency investments, the buying pressure could drive valuations over the moon.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also happen to think that the launch of these ETFs will give all of these pension funds a more readily accessible opportunity to get exposure to Bitcoin. The price impact will of course depend on whether we will see </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSSzCr2zTeM&amp;t=282s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">any spot backed futures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instruments being launched. Of course, it's great to see that the CIO of the Houston Firefighters fund appreciates the difference between synthetic and spot exposure.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That aside, what I find really interesting about this is the fact that pension funds are viewing cryptocurrencies as a sound investment. We in the crypto space know why it's such an appealing asset class, but Pension Funds have to view risk and reward through a different lense.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it seems increasingly clear that in an era of high inflation and meagre returns, they can‚Äôt afford not to get involved in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As JP Morgan </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/21/bitcoins-inflation-narrative-more-compelling-than-etf-fever-jpm-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, inflation is a more compelling narrative than the ETFs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, keep an eye on what‚Äôs happening in the pension fund space. It is the $35 Trillion gorilla in the room..</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîù </span><b>Top Newbie Tips üîù</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the crypto market is back to breaking all time highs, you know what that means: FOMO, scammers, hackers, and a whole lot of volatility.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with FOMO, there‚Äôs a famous saying I always tell myself when I see an altcoin I feel like I just have to invest in: ‚Äúhaste makes waste‚Äù. If you‚Äôre rushing in to buy an alt because of its price action, chances are you‚Äôre about to buy the local top, or worse, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/W5MCQJR-yWA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the cycle top</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What comes up, must come down, so wait until it comes down, and decide then if it's a good buy. NFA, of course.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, the scammers. Google‚Äôs threat analysis group</span><a href="https://decrypt.co/84088/hackers-hijacking-youtube-channels-broadcast-crypto-scams-google"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that hackers are hijacking large YouTube accounts to run their fake crypto livestream giveaways. As you all know, I keep the Coin Bureau under lock and key, so much so that I once locked myself out (and some of you might know that too haha). However, the same can‚Äôt be said for other accounts, so be on the lookout for </span><a href="https://youtu.be/AFhSf0l_aQQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anything fishy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from your favorite YouTubers, and report it as soon as you see it.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the hackers. It looks like CoinMarketCap was recently hacked, and over 3 million emails were leaked. CoinMarketCap </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinmarketcap-hack-reportedly-leaks-3-1-million-user-email-addresses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that no passwords were leaked, but I have my doubts given that it seems like they weren‚Äôt even aware of the hack until it had been posted to </span><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pro tip: never ever use the same email/password combination on any website, because that‚Äôs apparently how most hacks happen.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, volatility. If you have the time, go to your favorite exchange, pull up the price of BTC or ETH on the daily, and scroll all the way back to the top of the last bull market. Prices spiked or dropped by more than 10 percent per day as we approached the top, and it‚Äôs going to be the same story this time around.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory there should be less volatility now that there‚Äôs more adoption, but I wouldn‚Äôt count on it. IMO, it‚Äôs going to be a very bumpy ride to the moon.</span></p>
<p><b>üî• Deals of The Week üî•</b></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><b>üå¥ Hot NFTs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, some of you are probably happy with your core crypto portfolios and are looking to branch out into more exotic crypto assets.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of these more punchy assets I have exposure to are blockchain domains, which are issued as NFTs. As you guys know, I‚Äôm a fan of those NFTs that provide utility and that is exactly what these do. They basically allow you to replace your crypto addresses with easy to communicate names like coinbureau.crypto!</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason that I think it's such an attractive asset class is because it‚Äôs combining the current craze of NFTs with the domaining craze of the early 2000s.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I actually did a video all about the potential of blockchain domains and would certainly recommend that you </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO3yqHQyc8E&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watch that!</span></a></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But where can you pick up those NFT blockchain domains?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üòä </span><b>The Easy Way To Get Into Crypto: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest challenges getting into crypto for those new to it is finding an attractive fiat gateway. This is especially the case for those of us based out here in Europe.¬†</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easiest solution I have found for all that has got to be the </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/swissborg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swissborg App</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I actually use it for myself to cashout crypto to my bank account and those withdrawals sometimes hit in just minutes!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 crypto assets are available for trading here. That includes blue chips like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as more punchy plays like Audius.¬†</span></p>

		<Title>October 31, 2021 - INSIDER TRADING Scandal!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About a month ago, it was revealed that several top officials at the Federal Reserve had been trading stocks, bonds and other assets during a time of the most unprecedented Fed action in its 100 year history.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many have pointed out that this is insider trading by the ultimate insiders - those at the helm of the money printing machine.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, whether these individuals did in fact trade on material nonpublic information is yet to be determined. But it did create further distrust in a Federal Reserve that has already lost a great deal of credibility due to their handling of inflation.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I think that this insider trading scandal could have much more severe implications for the Fed than most people think. That is because it could provide perfect fodder for those opposed to Jerome Powell to replace him. To replace him with someone who would be more accommodative to lax monetary policy. Someone who would allow inflation to run rampant just so long as it served the broader agenda of those in power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, if this reality is to come to pass and inflation turns to hyperinflation (as Jack Dorsey predicted), what would it mean for assets like Bitcoin?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is all covered in my video today which you can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">watch here.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚úÖ </span><b>FUD about Causing FUD ‚úÖ</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes when I make a video that raises concerns about a project, diehard community members accuse me of ‚Äúspreading FUD‚Äù. This could not be furthest from the truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I research a crypto project, I leave absolutely no stone unturned. Not only that, but I have a whole team of people who are helping me do the same.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We watch every single interview</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We read through every single blog post</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We comb through every single page of a project‚Äôs documentation¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect every single news story about a crypto project that we can</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We even dig deep into their social media and the social media of their founders</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put things into perspective, the document that contains this research is usually twice and sometimes three times as long as the script that I write when I make the video - so yeah, it‚Äôs pretty damn thorough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes I will find stuff that‚Äôs seriously questionable, and this is more so the case for some crypto projects than it is for others. That said, no crypto project is perfect and I always voice my concerns at the end regardless of the project and I also always leave links to the relevant resources in the video description.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre wondering why I don‚Äôt reach out to a crypto project when I find something concerning, it‚Äôs because I already know what they‚Äôre going to say...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They‚Äôre going to tell me that everything is super-fast, super decentralized, super secure, that the coin or token distribution is super equitable and so on. Not surprisingly, this is exactly what the founders and communities of some crypto projects will say when I raise valid concerns based on information that‚Äôs publicly available and verifiable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The backlash that we receive from these community members can sometimes be strong and sustained. It‚Äôs a challenge to deal with such an onslaught but I will never waiver. That is because it‚Äôs my mission to bring you the most unbiased and impartial crypto education I can.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Am I saying that I always get things right? Hell no!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes I get things wrong, because sometimes we‚Äôll miss a news piece or blog post. This happened recently with Algorand for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is that I only issue a correction if what I said runs contrary to publicly available and verifiable information, which is why I issued a correction for Algorand at the start of my </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tc1kPQkDEY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algorand tutorial video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should go without saying that some fancy meme or video or tweet by a crypto project founder or top community member created in response to my concerns doesn‚Äôt count as a source. If you count stuff like that as a source, don‚Äôt be surprised if you end up getting hurt later down the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the saying goes: you can either be right, or you can make money. Always </span><a href="https://youtu.be/HCLWDGYnAzk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">do your own research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead of taking a crypto project or its community members at their word.¬†</span></p>
<p><b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes to the portfolio this week guys. Not too many attractively priced opportunities at the moment that really caught my eye.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, given that I have </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1454145680881197068?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently signed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a podcast deal, I have been looking to reward myself with an NFT - just something to remember the moment. I‚Äôm doing due-diligence on some collections at the moment and speaking to resident NFT experts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, I will keep you updated on my portfolio changes as well as my NFT hunt in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 26.79% | BTC 21.73% | SOL 11.84% | DOT 10.82% | USDC 5.40% | PAXG 3.72% | RUNE 3.60% | ATOM 3.34% | UST 3.06% | ADA 2.54% | HNT 2.23% | INJ 1.58% | MATIC 1.31% | LINK 1.06% | AR 1.00%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs been another hot week in the crypto market, and it looks like the money has finally started moving from BTC into altcoins. The first recipient of this momentum tends to be ETH, and when you couple that with the Altair upgrade that happened on Wednesday, you have a recipe for a new all time high. That‚Äôs </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-hits-new-ath-after-altair-upgrade-shows-clear-path-to-the-merge"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exactly what we got</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it looks like ETH isn‚Äôt done quite yet.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look at ETH‚Äôs price action on the daily chart and zoom out, you‚Äôll see that there are two big bullish patterns. The first is the huge cup and handle which began forming way back in mid-May. The second is the inverse head and shoulders which began forming in early September.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These two patterns point to a 6k ETH in the coming weeks, and I bet the news that‚Äôll take it there is the announcement of an Ethereum futures ETF which some experts are expecting in early 2022. That‚Äôs because of the </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cd3fd286-7d4c-4047-9539-05ee41501f6a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amount of options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expiring in March of next year with high strike prices.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The altcoin that caught my eye this week though was Litecoin (also Shiba Inu, but I‚Äôll get back to that dog in a bit). As reported by </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/litecoin-transactions-near-an-all-time-high-after-gaining-ground-in-consumer-finance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinTelegraph</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, transactions on the Litecoin blockchain recently approached all time highs.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This seems to be due to the release of the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/litecoin/status/1452329007047979009?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Litecoin Visa Debit card</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but I wonder if what we‚Äôre seeing is whales preparing for the release of the highly anticipated Mimblewimble side chain. For those that don‚Äôt know, this will give Litecoin privacy-preserving features that will allow users to send anonymous transactions.¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, this wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal were it not for the fact that LTC still hasn‚Äôt popped like other large cap alts. Even though LTC is quite a way away from it's all time high, it is in a visible uptrend, and this makes me wonder when it will finally pop. I really think Mimblewimble is what will do the trick, and you can learn all about it by watching my most recent video about </span><a href="https://youtu.be/EkAJVZy7qNo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Litecoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I let the dogs out, I‚Äôll give a quick congratulations to anyone holding metaverse related cryptocurrencies such as Decentraland (MANA), The Sandbox (SAND), and Axie Infinity (AXS).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these cryptocurrencies</span><a href="https://decrypt.co/84769/decentraland-metaverse-tokens-surge-wake-facebooks-meta-rebrand"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rallied like crazy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of Facebook‚Äôs metaverse announcement, which is very interesting to say the least. If history is any indication, these price pumps will be short lived, so keep that in mind before you feel too much FOMO. Speaking of which‚Ä¶¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üêï </span><b>Thoughts on Shiba Inu üêï</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few months ago, I </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-a8YeIVpzA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made a video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Shiba Inu. I thought it at least warranted a video given that Coinbase had announced they would be listing it. It was an interesting video to research and there was a lot more to the project than I had initially thought.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I speculated, Coinbase was likely holding off on a SHIB listing until the devs released the Shibaswap DEX. This would make the project sufficiently ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù to meet Coinbase‚Äôs arbitrary listing requirements. I also mentioned in the video that the listing of SHIB on Coinbase would give retail traders an opportunity to pile in on a ‚Äúcheap‚Äù altcoin.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I didn‚Äôt expect was just how much SHIB would rally. This week it briefly overtook Dogecoin and even Polkadot.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, this once again got me thinking: What on Earth is going on?¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there are a combination of factors. Some are rational, some irrational. On the irrational side, there are people that are buying it because they think its low price is indicative of value. As is always the case, you have to consider the market cap of a coin to determine its upside potential. SHIB will </span><b>never reach</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1 cent as that will imply a market cap 5 times bigger than Bitcoin.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôm not saying that all SHIB holders think this, but there is a strong contingent of first time buyers that do. I still run into people who won‚Äôt buy Bitcoin because they say they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt afford it‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the more rational side, unlike Dogecoin, there are things being built on Shiba Inu. Shibaswap seems to be working as intended and Shiba Inu has just launched Shiboshi which are their NFTs. Do not underestimate the retail appeal of memecoin mania mixed with NFT hype - it‚Äôs bound to draw interest.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of this, you also have to consider the power of the community drive behind the project at this point. They are creating a SHIB army that is rallying to get businesses to accept SHIB for payment (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1454023849528410115?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies like AMC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for example).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This army is also able to create a self reinforcing price &amp; hype cycle. The more people want to trade it, the more exchanges start listing it, and the more people are exposed to it who will then also trade it. For example, there is now an </span><a href="https://www.change.org/p/robinhood-convince-robinhood-they-will-prosper-if-they-list-shiba-inu-coin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get Robinhood to list SHIB.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the CEO of Robinhood has been mum about a listing, I think it's only a matter of time. Their crypto revenue is </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-26/robinhood-crypto-trading-craters-as-revenue-misses-estimates"><span style="font-weight: 400;">down 78%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the last quarter and they are hemorrhaging cash. Listing a token with such high demand would go a long way to getting them back into the black. Moreover, it seems illogical for them to offer Dogecoin and object to Shiba Inu - especially given the fact that the latter has more utility &amp; use cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of all this, you have to consider that there are a lot of people taking out leveraged positions in SHIB. Open interest on SHIB futures contracts is </span><a href="https://prnt.sc/1xnwnv8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">near record high</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it appears that most of these are in long positions. </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/shiba-inu-fetches-a-new-ath-3-reasons-why-shib-keeps-jumping-higher"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some think</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that those that are taking on this leverage may be reinvesting their profits into further buying SHIB in the spot market thereby pushing up the price more. Moreover, there is no appetite to short SHIB right now for obvious reasons.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, with these factors in play, it's hard to tell where SHIB goes. Fundamentally, it is due for a correction at some point but I would be lying if I said I knew exactly when. Whales </span><a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1453490968221597696?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hold a large proportion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the supply and any sales by these individuals could tank the price. You then also have to consider the possibility of cascading liquidations that could come from those overleveraged.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, if you hold Shiba Inu, tread carefully. It doesn‚Äôt deserve the hate it gets, but it's no Ethereum, Cardano or Polkadot. My opinion of course &amp; </span><a href="https://store.coinbureau.com/product/no-financial-advisor-white-t-shirt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not financial advice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîí </span><b>Max Crypto Security: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">With crypto prices recently going through the roof, now is probably a good time to reevaluate your crypto security setup.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks ago, I </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1203"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told you guys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the benefits of the Shamir backup. This basically allows you to setup multiple seed words on your hardware wallet and require a certain number of seeds to reset a hardware wallet and regain access to that crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you might set up three seeds with a Shamir backup and require that two seeds are used to be able to regain access to that crypto. That means that if you lose access to one set of seed words, then that crypto is not lost forever.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also means that cracking that hardware wallet isn‚Äôt as simple as a crypto thief finding one set of seed words and getting access to your stash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hardware wallet that I am personally using to secure my coins and tokens with a Shamir backup is the </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/trezor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor Model-T.¬†</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh yes, it also supports over 1000 coins and tokens too. So, that Trezor Model-T is pretty much a one stop storage solution when it comes to crypto.</span></p>

		<Title>November 7, 2021 - How The Rich Get Richer!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs pretty crazy to think that in a year when countries saw their biggest falls in GDP for almost a century, the World‚Äôs billionaires got 54% richer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only that, but they paid very little (if any tax) on these gains.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, one of the reasons that the really rich can get richer is because they efficiently use tax codes to their advantage. A tax code that was written with only one group of people in mind - them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has also ignited a debate around the world about what the best way is to tax these Billionaires. Contrary to public opinion, it‚Äôs a lot harder to actually do it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs why I decided to go down this rabbit hole and explore exactly how these folks are able to avoid so much taxes. I also examine some of the proposals that have been floated around capital gains and what impact these could have on the markets (including crypto).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No partisan hype here. Just a data driven analysis from an impartial Libertarian crypto guy. This is all covered in my latest video which you can watch </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Pk_iEdHieSc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over here.&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<p><b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who saw </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjxja5wB1UI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week on Fantom, I had decided to allocate some of my portfolio to the FTM. It really is an exciting project with strong development, an ambitious roadmap and highly scalable tech.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sold some of my PAXG and MATIC to buy this FTM. In terms of other projects that I am looking into, I am really excited about some of the projects building on the Metaverse and I will be looking into a few of these in the coming week.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, I will keep you guys updated in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 25.78% | BTC 19.74% | SOL 14.13% | DOT 12.22% | USDC 4.82% | RUNE 3.46% | HNT 3.11% | ATOM 2.96% | UST 2.72% | ADA 2.31% | PAXG 2.17% | INJ 1.77% | FTM 1.54% | AR 1.40% | LINK 1.03% | MATIC 0.84%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined hit a new all time high of 2.75 trillion dollars (</span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to CoinMarketCap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at least). That‚Äôs 200 billion more than the total market cap we saw at the last peak back in May just before the big correction, and that‚Äôs no coincidence. As I mentioned in last week‚Äôs </span><a href="https://youtu.be/3OTJ4hMRH-k"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I think we‚Äôre on the cusp of another correction, and not just because we‚Äôve hit another market cap milestone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, the Federal Reserve recently confirmed that they will be reducing their government bond purchases, which currently total </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/business/economy/fed-taper-questions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">120 billion dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per month. For those who don‚Äôt know, the demand for government bonds determines the baseline interest rate for saving and borrowing. Low demand = high interest rates, and high demand = low interest rates. Given that the Federal Reserve will start reducing their bond purchases by </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/579879-federal-reserve-announces-tapering-of-bond-purchases"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 billion dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per month, interest rates could rise in response.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a problem for two reasons. First, increasing interest rates means that borrowing becomes more expensive. This means that not only will consumers spend less on goods but also that companies will reduce lending to fund investment. This means less consumer demand for goods and services of companies and less investments by said companies. Effectively, a drag on earnings and share prices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, and more importantly, institutional investors see Bitcoin as an </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/10/08/bitcoin-not-gold-is-the-new-inflation-hedge-says-jp-morgan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inflation hedge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the FED‚Äôs tapering somehow successfully reduces inflation, this could reduce demand for Bitcoin among institutional investors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other factors that could crush the crypto market in the coming weeks relate to regulations. As I discussed in </span><a href="https://youtu.be/nFSOfkalDK4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">yesterday‚Äôs video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the FATF‚Äôs finalised crypto ‚Äúrecommendations‚Äù, we might be on the cusp of a global crackdown on cryptocurrency in the name of money laundering, and some counties have </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/05/s-korean-regulator-says-nfts-are-not-virtual-assets-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already begun </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">implementing the FATF‚Äôs crypto ‚Äúrecommendations‚Äù.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the FATF‚Äôs focuses is of course stablecoins, and last Monday the ‚ÄúPresident‚Äôs Working Group on Financial Markets‚Äù issued their own </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/01/biden-administration-to-congress-put-stablecoins-under-federal-supervision-or-we-will/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">finalised ‚Äúrecommendations‚Äù</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as to how stablecoins should be treated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oddly enough, they praised the fact that stablecoins ‚Äúsupport faster, more efficient, and more inclusive payments options‚Äù, but stressed the importance of regulating stablecoin issuers in the same way as banks. Call me crazy, but it sounds like</span><a href="https://youtu.be/jWM-MdT2rDg"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> my conspiracy </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">about USDC becoming the US government‚Äôs CBDC is starting to come true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last macro factor to consider is what is due to happen any day now - and that deserves its own section.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è </span><b>Infrastructure Bill&nbsp; üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the US House finally passed the infrastructure bill. This means it can finally make its way to Biden‚Äôs desk to be signed into law. For those that have been following, this is the bill that has some anti-crypto provisions. If you have not been following, there are numerous videos on the channel but I covered it briefly in my </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OTJ4hMRH-k&amp;t=20s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weekly news update</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what does this mean now?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well firstly, let‚Äôs address the concerns‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first one is on the expanded definition of a ‚Äúbroker‚Äù for tax reporting purposes. This won‚Äôt just be an exchange or Virtual Asset Service provider but </span><b><i>could</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also be interpreted to include miners, node operators and potentially DeFi developers. The complications and the near impossibility of complying with this provision are immense.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second provision is all of 8 words and is an amendment to section 6050I of the tax code. For those that don‚Äôt know, this </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/government-entities/indian-tribal-governments/itg-faq-1-answer-what-is-irc-section-6050i"><span style="font-weight: 400;">section of the tax code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has required businesses or individuals that receive physical cash or bank transfers over $10,000 to file a form with the IRS. This form sets out information such as name, address, and Social Security Number. Not complying with this provision is actually considered a felony!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The limited amendment has now changed the word ‚Äúcash‚Äù to ‚Äúany digital asset‚Äù as a definition. So, interpreted broadly, this means that anyone who receives over 10k in crypto (think buying an NFT) will have to collect this information. Yet again, another near impossibility.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, on the face of it, these provisions don‚Äôt look good. But, as always, there is a lot more nuance to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly and most importantly, these don‚Äôt go into effect until January of 2024. That is a long time in politics and it's especially long when you consider how volatile the US political landscape is. The Democrats are in a vulnerable position in 2022 and the president‚Äôs </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/11/3/22761425/joe-biden-approval-virginia-new-jersey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approval rating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has taken a real beating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Democrats lose the house &amp; senate next year, then there is the chance that a Republican controlled congress could introduce legislation that could blunt these provisions. There is also the possibility that the altered definition of section 6050l may be unconstitutional - that‚Äôs at least </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1456823505601941507?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Jerry Brito</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the CoinCenter think tank. As an aside, Coin Center has been one of the most effective crypto lobbying forces so give Jerry a follow to keep up with developments from Capitol Hill.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the fact that these provisions only go into effect in 2024, it‚Äôs still important to stress that it's all open for interpretation by the Treasury. They have even come out and said that they </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-13/treasury-seeks-to-quell-fears-crypto-tax-rules-are-overly-broad"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won‚Äôt be including</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> miners and developers etc. in their interpretation. I am inclined to also believe that. Not because they don‚Äôt want to grab that tax revenue but because it would be an impossibility to enforce.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is perhaps the reason why crypto markets have had a relatively moot reaction to the passing of the bill. As I explained in my </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1456949539382906889?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tweet yesterday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the news appears to have been priced in. Participants are viewing this bill as glass half full and are focused on all the other really exciting developments taking place.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it‚Äôs not going to be an easy battle against the politicians, but </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1456388965611753478"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this tweet thread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Jake Chervinsky should give you some optimism.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>üîù Top Market Tips üîù</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúBe fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful‚Äù. This famous quote by billionaire investor Warren Buffett is more relevant than ever these days, because we‚Äôre seeing </span><a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lot of greed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the crypto market these days.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I reckon that‚Äôs pretty clear without any indicators. Shiba Inu hitting </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/shiba-inu-surges-over-45-in-two-days-to-reach-an-all-time-high"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all time highs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, retail investors piling into meme coins that are </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/squid-token-up-600-today-despite-debacle-and-binance-investigation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obviously scams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and most importantly, me making a video comparing </span><a href="https://youtu.be/u7QJuJ1JWQc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiba Inu and Dogecoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this mean you should be fearful? Absolutely. The market has been insanely bullish and you might be sitting on some amazing gains right now, but the road to the moon is bumpy, not smooth. Ask yourself if you‚Äôre willing to hold the cryptos you have now through a 20, 30, maybe even 50 percent drop. If you don‚Äôt think you can, you‚Äôve either invested too much or know deep down that you‚Äôre gambling, not investing. This is one of the many </span><a href="https://youtu.be/jeV42mB6a4o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trading mistakes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can make, and it‚Äôs one that‚Äôs easy to make with how bullish the crypto market is.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You guys know that I am a fan of the saying ‚Äúwhen in doubt, zoom out‚Äù. This is usually applied to long timeframe price charts that allow you to get a better idea of how far the market has come. However, it can also be applied to those cryptocurrencies that have spiked up to irrational hype driven levels. For example, here is the long term </span><a href="https://prnt.sc/1yjy7pv"><span style="font-weight: 400;">price action of MANA.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, that spike seemed to come out of nowhere but it was mostly around the Facebook announcement of the rebranding to Meta. People rushed into all Metaverse related tokens like MANA etc. Does that price action really look that sustainable to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, I am also really bullish on the Metaverse and think that projects like Decentraland and the Sandbox have amazing potential (a video is coming soon). But the point is that you should always take a look at longer time frames when considering whether short term price action could be sustainable. That‚Äôs because periods of consolidation do tend to follow.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings me to my last tip, and that‚Äôs to soak up the dip. Yes, corrections suck, and they can be terrifying to watch when you have a lot of money invested in the crypto market. However, they are necessary for the bull market to continue, and they offer an opportunity to buy up any coins or tokens you were interested in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I promise you that when the dominos fall, in most cases you‚Äôll see that out of the 5 or 10 cryptos you wanted, only 1 or 2 of them were really worth your time or money after all. Make sure to watch my video about </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Prkv45GfGUg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to buy the dip</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so you‚Äôre ready when it comes around, and trust me, it will come eventually.&nbsp;</span></p>

		<Title>November 14, 2021 - Latest ETH Predictions You CAN‚ÄôT MISS!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you know from my weekly newsletter, I hold a reasonable part of my portfolio in Ether. Earlier this week, ETH broke through its all time highs and appears set to breach $5k any day now.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons for this. Reasons which I have illuminated on the numerous videos I have done on Ethereum over the past year. However, I can confidently say that I am just as bullish today as I was then.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Factors like utility demand in DeFi and NFTs is leading to a mad rush for block space. Reduced supply from fee burns is making it a rare asset. The looming PoS Merge could supercharge these fee burns and bring sustained deflation.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This of course is not going unnoticed. Investment demand is picking up as whales &amp; institutions are stacking and staking ETH at record levels. And, according to the latest research and reports from some of the investment banks, this trend is only likely to continue.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I cover all of this in my latest Ethereum update video. I also delve into some of the most exciting price predictions and analysis that I have seen to date. This is not a video you want to miss. You can watch </span><a href="https://youtu.be/LiofrQwmLTI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it here!</span></a>

<b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes to the portfolio this week guys. However, on Tuesday </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1458060558897500165?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did claim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> some ENS from the airdrop which occurred the day before (more on that below). It‚Äôs quite a small % so it's not included in the breakdown.¬†¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few tokens / coins that are on my radar which I may include in the coming week. As always, I will keep you updated on this in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram Channel.¬†</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 26.42% | BTC 21.01% | SOL 13.57% | DOT 10.89% | USDC 4.95% | HNT 3.60% | RUNE 3.11% | UST 2.83% | ATOM 2.69% | ADA 2.41% | PAXG 2.30% | INJ 1.58% | FTM 1.46% | AR 1.29% | LINK 1.09% | MATIC 0.78%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs been a bit of a mixed week in the crypto market. BTC has been on a steady decline over the last few days while select altcoins continue to hit new all time highs. Most of these are related to the metaverse, and I covered </span><a href="https://youtu.be/KqJU_9g8Wh0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of these cryptos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the rest of the market is in a bit of a slump, I would be very cautious about any cryptocurrencies going against the grain, especially if they look as overextended as many of these metaverse plays.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre wondering where the FUD is coming from, the answer seems to be stablecoin regulation, something I </span><a href="https://youtu.be/F27Wqgdz6fw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also recently covered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The TLDR there is that US regulators want US politicians to put laws in place that subjects stablecoin issuers to the same standards as banks. This might sound a bit scary, but it centers almost entirely around insurance and the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/TxcTDNHSS-U"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assets backing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the stablecoin tokens in circulation.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another factor that seems to be weighing the crypto market down is the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/sec-rejects-vaneck-etf-that-sought-to-track-bitcoin-directly.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent rejection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of VanEck‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETF. In contrast to the futures Bitcoin ETFs we have now, a physically backed or spot Bitcoin ETF is </span><a href="https://youtu.be/DJE6-mrjnqk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backed by actual BTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means the company issuing the ETF shares has to actually go out and buy BTC to back those shares, which has a direct (ish) effect on the price of BTC. Futures backed Bitcoin ETFs just create deviations in BTC futures prices.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the bright side, we seem to be on the cusp of a </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/ethereum-futures-etf-more-likely-than-bitcoin-fund-bi-says?sref=qpwbmgSU&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social"><span style="font-weight: 400;">futures backed Ethereum ETF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (something I covered in my video today). I know I just said that this would have no direct effect on the price of the crypto in question (in this case ETH), but it does have an indirect effect.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the hype around the event itself, a futures backed Ethereum ETF would give a lot of legitimacy to ETH as an asset. A lot of institutional investors </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ken-griffin-says-bitcoin-will-be-replaced-by-ethereum-based-currency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are fans of ETH too</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so it‚Äôs possible we could see additional indirect factors pushing up its price.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of what‚Äôs in store for the crypto market this week, it looks like BTC will continue drifting down to between 61-62k where there‚Äôs a lot of price support. However, it‚Äôs also possible that we could see a sudden reversal come Monday, and that‚Äôs because of Bitcoin‚Äôs upcoming Taproot upgrade that‚Äôs </span><a href="https://taproot.watch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scheduled to happen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today- this requires its own section‚Ä¶</span>

<b>üö∞ Taproot Upgrade üö∞</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming Bitcoin‚Äôs Taproot upgrade goes smoothly, it should be live by the time you read this sentence. Taproot </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-s-upcoming-taproot-upgrade-and-why-it-matters-for-the-network"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is admittedly technical</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the simple explanation is that the Taproot upgrade makes every BTC transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain look identical. This is more significant than you think, and that‚Äôs for three reasons. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, institutional investors often use multi signature wallets to </span><a href="https://youtu.be/MA2HJ0xew2Q"><span style="font-weight: 400;">custody their BTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Prior to Taproot, BTC transactions made from these multi-sig wallets were easy to spot using a blockchain explorer. Obviously this created some degree of risk because you could theoretically figure out who holds the keys to these wallets and force them to sign a transaction. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Taproot, transactions made from multi sig wallets look like a transaction made from a regular wallet. This increases privacy for institutional investors which should theoretically make them more comfortable investing in BTC. It could also make the SEC more willing to approve a </span><a href="https://youtu.be/FSSzCr2zTeM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">physically backed Bitcoin ETF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it would make BTC custody for such an ETF more secure for the same reason.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Second,</span><a href="https://youtu.be/J3cQNpOR_a0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bitcoin‚Äôs Lightning Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is arguably the key to global Bitcoin adoption. Prior to Taproot, the multi sig transactions used to open and close Lightning Network channels were likewise easy to spot using a blockchain explorer. Again, this created some degree of risk because you could theoretically figure out which two parties are a part of that payment channel.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With Taproot, transactions made from multi sig wallets when Lightning Network channels are opened and closed look identical to a transaction made from a regular wallet. This increases privacy for Lightning Network users, and </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-irs-offers-a-625-000-bounty-to-anyone-who-can-break-monero-and-lightning"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulatory rhetoric suggests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the privacy of the Lightning Network is on par with Monero. This should theoretically make the Lightning Network a sort of high performance privacy layer for BTC transactions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but certainly not least, Taproot could be a precursor to the blow off top of this bull market. Bitcoin‚Äôs last upgrade happened in August 2017. This upgrade was called </span><a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/segwit-segregated-witness/?"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Segwit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it essentially doubled Bitcoin‚Äôs transaction speed.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Four months after Segwit went live, BTC hit its all time high of nearly 20k. Now obviously there‚Äôs no guarantee the same thing will happen this time around, but it‚Äôs certainly something to keep in mind going into early 2022.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ü™Ç </span><b>Free Crypto!¬† ü™Ç</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday I was happy to learn that I got some free crypto sent my way. That was in the form of the ENS airdrop that was given to all of those addresses who own or who had owned an ENS domain name (.eth).¬†¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I explained earlier, I will be hodling that ENS for some time but the main thing I wanted to talk about is just how lucrative these airdrops can be. I have received a number of these over the past year and many of them were completely unexpected. For example, I had received the UNI &amp; 1INCH airdrops last year as well as the </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1101"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DYDX one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I happen to think that we could see a flood of airdrops in the coming months. That is mainly as a result of projects trying to quickly decentralise themselves while still keeping the community engaged with the protocol / dApp itself. Moreover, it will allow for community governance that will take the heat off of the protocol developers from overzealous regulators.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, this all then begs the question: Can you predict airdrops?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it‚Äôs not an exact science as it always comes down to the decision of the project team itself. They may have very specific legal or operational reasons as to why they want to avoid any sort of distribution. For example, many may want to avoid airdropping to US residents (thank the SEC for that).¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, while the airdrops that you read about in the press are lucrative, there is a minefield of really low value airdrops happening on substandard protocols. There are also a lot of scam airdrops out there that tend to sucker in the newer crypto users.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said all this though, I happen to think that there are still some really high valued Airdrops around the corner and there are a number of things that you can look for. I should of course caveat that this is all my </span><b><i>personal opinion</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b><i>speculation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, as I explained in a </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1264"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other day, a prime candidate could be MetaMask. There was a lot of speculation about this before and it seems long overdue. If you want to increase your chances, consider using the MetaMask AMM to swap some tokens. If you were going to swap something anyway, it's a win-win.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then you have to consider all the other popular Ethereum Layer 2 solutions that don‚Äôt have their own token yet. These include the likes of Arbitrum &amp; Optimism. I have given a guide on how to use these </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L52zhkDYzvM&amp;t=11s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protocols here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and they are a great way to reduce gas fees. If there is a small chance you could get a future airdrop - all the better.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then you also have to consider some of the NFT marketplaces that are out there. A prime example here is Opensea which, unlike Rarible and SuperRare, does not have a governance token. Could they consider dropping one? Maybe, maybe not. But if you were considering picking up an NFT at all, you may as well use it as it‚Äôs the most popular - </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LnN5rfiVYU&amp;t=4s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guide here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, while we are on the topic of NFTs, some of the most popular collections are dropping community / governance tokens to the holders. For example, recently you had the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/03/loot-holders-get-51k-agld-airdrop-because-nfts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AGLD airdrop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on all holders of Adventure gold. There are so many of these going on that I can‚Äôt mention all of them. But, if you were thinking of buying an NFT at all, consider looking into those that have opened the door to potential airdrops.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You also have to consider that everything I have mentioned above is on the Ethereum blockchain. There is extensive potential for other airdrops on other chains like Solana, Avalanche, Cardano etc.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot more to the airdrop conundrum and I will be coming back to it with an updated video guide - but thought that I would share some initial hints and tips here.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚≠ê </span><b>Rising Exchange Star: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/ftx/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has exploded to become the fourth biggest crypto exchange. That raise has seemingly come out of nowhere.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason behind that increase in popularity is probably due to the vast array of fiat currencies supported by FTX and the fact that around 275 altcoins are on the shelves here.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, trading fees are super low here and most people can crush those down to a mere </span><b>0.06%! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To place that into context, fees on Kraken Pro can be up to 4.5 times higher!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those sort of fee discounts are possible due to a special deal I have been able to secure you. In addition, you‚Äôll get your first</span><b> $30 in trading fees for FREE here!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still need to learn more about FTX? Well, you can watch </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywJdQxTBF0g&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my dedicated video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> telling you everything you need to know about the exchange!</span>

<b>Based in the US? üá∫üá∏</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well, the good news is that FTX has it‚Äôs very own version of the exchange for Americans.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/ftx-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign Up To FTX US</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; Your First </span><b>$30 In Trading Fees Are FREE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> + You‚Äôll Get A </span><b>10% Fee Discount For Life!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, there are some differences between the global and US facing versions of FTX. So, you might want to learn all about them in my comprehensive </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFTZFdgJrjg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX US walkthrough!</span></a>

		<Title>November 21, 2021 - FREE Crypto!! Airdrops Incoming??</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you like to get free crypto?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all would! And thanks to community airdrops, this is entirely possible.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who has got my fair share of valuable airdrops, I think I know a thing or two for snuffling out these golden nuggets of opportunity.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is though that the vast majority of airdrops are completely worthless. In some cases, the gas &amp; time required to claim these airdrops can make them completely impractical. For every valuable airdrop that you read about in the crypto news, there are at least 20 that turn out to be worthless.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it‚Äôs essential that you have an idea of what to look for and how to maximise your chances of hitting the big time. That is exactly what I go over in my video today!¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will be giving you a complete 101 guide as to what airdrops are and why projects do them. I take you through some of the most valuable airdrops over the past year and what we could learn from them.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also give you some top tips of what to look out for in order to scout these out as well as my thoughts on which potential protocols could be next to drop a token.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><b><a href="https://cbtestw.kinsta.cloud/videos/airdrops-free-crypto-drops-could-these-be-next/">video here</a>.</b></p>
<p><b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bought the dip this week on ETH, BTC &amp; DOT. One has to practice what they preach and I think that the current shakeout was an amazing opportunity to do that. I emptied the clip on all of the USDC that I had been holding for this occasion.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of this, I have now officially bought my first Mutant Ape NFT from the Mutant Ape Yacht Club Collection. You can see if </span><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x60e4d786628fea6478f785a6d7e704777c86a7c6/5289"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (more info below). I am also looking to purchase a few more of these from this collection.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were no other changes apart from that. My updated portfolio is:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 28.76% | BTC 22.62% | SOL 13.23% | DOT 12.44% | HNT 3.47% | UST 3.04% | RUNE 2.89% | ATOM 2.61% | PAXG 2.46% | ADA 2.41% | INJ 1.67% | AR 1.38% | FTM 1.25% | LINK 1.00% | MATIC 0.79%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were surprised by the dip we saw last week, you probably haven‚Äôt been keeping up with my </span><a href="https://youtu.be/iSEoN6Cqi8o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weekly crypto review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. My crypto market predictions have been pretty good lately, but I must admit that my most recent one underestimated just how much we would drop. So, what happened? I can‚Äôt say for sure, but I have a few theories.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, BTC typically performs poorly in the second half of every month. This is because of </span><a href="https://youtu.be/yDXB1jafqg4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">options expiries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like a lot of options traders were betting that BTC would fall in value at the </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/here-s-why-bears-hope-to-pin-bitcoin-under-60k-ahead-of-friday-s-1-1b-options-expiry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">end of last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Depending on the volume of the outstanding options, these expiry events can have a significant impact on the spot market. In this case, those large Put Option buyers may have manipulated the spot price downward in order for the options to expire in-the-money (i.e., profitably).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, these price moves on expiry could be a self fulfilling prophecy, but it‚Äôs a pattern that‚Äôs been seen time and time again. I have covered these instruments on numerous occasions on the channel so feel free to watch my </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB__J2bCyjE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most recent video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on options data for more information.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is that last week‚Äôs BTC options bears were betting that BTC would drop to 58k, so why did it drop lower? The answer: overleveraged longs. Put simply, reckless traders used their BTC to borrow more BTC and bet that the price of BTC would go up. It didn‚Äôt and we saw over </span><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/crypto-markets/futures/btc-liquidations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">half a billion dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in overleveraged longs liquidated last week.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What this means is that half a billion dollars in BTC was automatically sold, causing the price of BTC to drop, which of course liquidated move overleveraged longs and so on. Normally this wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal. Half a billion dollars of liquidated longs is a normal week in the crypto market. The difference this time around is that </span><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=distribution.BalanceExchangesRelative"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC balances on exchanges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are very low.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When BTC balances on exchanges are low, this increases volatility because there are fewer people selling their BTC. This means that it takes a lot less money to move BTC prices up or down, and given that the BTC balance on exchanges </span><a href="https://youtu.be/pk1MyzlhBJk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continues to drop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it means we‚Äôre likely to continue to see this kind of volatility in the weeks ahead.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that this means investors continue to accumulate, and this is despite all of the FUD flying around about, stuff like the possibility of a </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/13/indian-government-to-take-progressive-steps-on-crypto-sources-say-after-pm-modis-meeting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto crackdown in India</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, US politicians sitting down </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-congress-plans-demystifying-crypto-committee-hearing-for-nov-17"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to discuss cryptocurrencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and last but not least, the infamous infrastructure bill being </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/president-biden-signs-infrastructure-bill-into-law-mandating-broker-reporting-requirements"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed into law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the US president. This requires its own section.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üá∫üá∏ </span><b>Capitol Hill Update üá∫üá∏</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might be wondering why what happens in the crypto market depends on what happens in the halls of Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. Besides the fact that a lot of the money in the crypto market came from US investors, US regulators also seem to have a huge influence over some of the largest global ‚Äúregulatory‚Äù bodies such as the FATF. More about that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/F27Wqgdz6fw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you might have gathered, a lot has been happening on Capitol Hill, and the development that‚Äôs most relevant to crypto is the infrastructure bill which has now become law. This means that poorly defined cryptocurrency ‚Äúbrokers‚Äù will have to collect KYC information about users for tax purposes, and all crypto transactions worth more than 10k USD must be reported to the IRS.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that these provisions don‚Äôt go into effect until 2024, and there are </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-fix-crypto-reporting-requirement-from-infrastructure-law"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some politicians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are looking to push the IRS reporting requirement back to 2026 as well as redefining the term ‚Äúbroker‚Äù. So far, a total of </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-lawmakers-push-back-on-crypto-provisions-in-infrastructure-bill"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 politicians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have signed on to the initiative, though it's not clear how far it will get for the time being.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is clear however is that cryptocurrency is starting to sway politicians, and this is thanks to the actions of crypto lobbying groups such as the Blockchain Association which </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/18/blockchain-association-raises-4m-to-grow-its-presence-on-capitol-hill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently raised 4 million dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Crypto lobbying groups might be why a </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/573751-house-passes-sweeping-defense-policy-bill"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently passed defense bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contains a clause that requires politicians to clarify crypto regulations.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the infrastructure bill out of the way, the crypto market has another bill to look forward to: the ‚Äúhuman infrastructure‚Äù bill which was recently renamed to the</span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/582300-house-passes-175t-spending-plan-in-hard-fought-democratic-win"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Build Back Better bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The deal was that if both sides of the aisle agreed to the infrastructure bill, the Build Back Better bill would pass without a hitch. This happened on Friday, but the bill still needs to be reviewed by the US senate.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not entirely clear what effect the Build Back Better bill could have as far as crypto regulations go. </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/79823/treasury-wants-crypto-reporting-rules-trillion-reconciliation-bill-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the US department of the Treasury was trying to add even more crypto tax provisions into this second bill. One thing is for sure though, the combined 3 trillion dollar value of these two spending packages will make inflation worse, and this will drive demand for BTC.¬†</span></p>
<p><b>üö∞ My NFT Purchase üö∞</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks ago, I told you guys that I was looking to buy an NFT to celebrate my podcast deal. This week I also asked for some of your </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1460227536693215235?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opinions on Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about which ones I should buy. There were a lot of suggestions there and it took me quite some time to go through them.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end though, I decided to pick up a Mutant Ape from the MAYC. I am also planning to buy at least 2 more over the coming weeks.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I would have loved to have picked up an original Bored Ape or even a punk, I thought that that money would have been better spent buying the recent crypto market dip.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is my view that the MAYC is a collection that has some of the most attractive return potential. That is because based on their relatively fair price, they confer a lot of the same benefits that come from being a member of the BAYC. Moreover, they have seen an </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-volumes-go-bananas-as-collectors-pile-back-into-bored-ape-yacht-club-nfts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explosion in trading volume</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth over the past 2 weeks (1,000% vs. 900% for the BAYC).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from this, there is a really strong case for some NFTs (and Apes in particular) to be an incredible asset over the longer term. Something that I read earlier this week was </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/86421/why-neeraj-agrawal-is-wrong-about-bored-ape-nfts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Andrew Miller, a famous domainer. I recall reading his original op-ed in August when he bought his Ape for $48k.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot deny the mass market appeal that comes from this collection. Over the past two weeks we have had individuals like </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jimmyfallon/status/1459164143626424321"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jimmy Falon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/post-malone-features-bayc-nfts-in-new-music-video-with-the-weeknd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Malone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> jumping into the BAYC with their purchases. This includes numerous other celebrities who are members including Shaquille O'neal who happens to also </span><a href="https://clutchpoints.com/lakers-news-shaquille-oneal-joins-the-nft-craze-with-huge-crypto-buys/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">own a Mutant Ape.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you remember </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwD-BBdBOk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on NFT collectibles a few months ago, I talked about this appeal for holding a rare asset that is immediately verifiable onchain. One that gives members access to a club that confers benefits from exclusive parties and events. This is something that people tend to place a great deal of importance on.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from their rarity and esteem, there are a number of other benefits that come from holding these apes in the future. As I mentioned in my video today, the Apes are likely to be the recipients of some pretty lucrative airdrops. Apart from the NFT airdrops that have already happened, I think that the Yuga Labs team is likely to release a number more of these. They have also confirmed that they are </span><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/119966/bored-ape-yacht-club-plans-to-launch-its-own-token-in-q1-of-2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aiming for a Q1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> airdrop of their token.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But finally, I think one of the most significant benefits of owning an Ape is the being part of the community. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the community includes any celebrities or not. It‚Äôs just the feeling of belonging to like minded individuals who appreciate the appeal of these NFTs. It‚Äôs exactly the same feeling I get when I interact with fellow crypto enthusiasts and one of the main reasons I want to hold a crypto </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1446175812991033344?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">event next year.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, I am under no illusion that NFTs are incredibly risky. Many of them will be worthless in the long run. But that‚Äôs why I have taken a measured play on it at the moment. Even if it goes to 0, the impact on my broader diversified crypto portfolio won‚Äôt be as severe. So, if you guys are considering any NFTs, I encourage you to use a similar mindset.¬†</span></p>

		<Title>November 28, 2021 - DON‚ÄôT TOUCH These Sh*tcoins!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get asked by so many people about which coins or tokens they should invest in. However, something that I very rarely get asked is which coins / tokens they should avoid...¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs because knowing how to spot a shitcoin can be just as helpful as knowing how to find that next hidden gem. It‚Äôs a known fact that the ratio of poor quality cryptocurrencies to hidden gems is about 9:1.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, if you randomly selected a cryptocurrency to invest in, you have a greater chance that it will turn out worthless in the long run.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in my video today, I take you through a comprehensive checklist that you can use when doing your due diligence. If a cryptocurrency that you are considering investing in meets at least three of these characteristics then you may want to steer clear.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also highly encourage you to share this video with any of your friends who are just jumping in those crypto markets - it could save them from getting rekt in the long run.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes to the portfolio this week guys. I think that we still have a bit of near-term uncertainty in the coming weeks (see next section). I am really interested in some GameFi plays but some appear to be a bit overvalued.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my NFT portfolio, I have picked up an additional two Mutant Apes. As I mentioned in my newsletter last week, I am particularly excited about the BAYC community and what they are working on. That being said, the NFT space is becoming quite saturated (see NFT NGMI section below).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My updated portfolio is:¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 29.31% | BTC 22.53% | SOL 13.15% | DOT 11.39% | RUNE 3.29% | HNT 3.26% | UST 3.24% | ATOM 2.69% | PAXG 2.54% | ADA 2.16% | INJ 1.98% | FTM 1.38% | AR 1.27% | LINK 0.93% | MATIC 0.87%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs been a predictable end of the month as far as crypto prices go. On Friday we saw another big </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-bulls-risk-losing-365-million-upon-friday-s-btc-options-expiry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">options expiry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which dragged down the market the same way last week‚Äôs option‚Äôs expiry did. There is another macro factor that‚Äôs weighing on the crypto markets, however.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like Jerome Powell is going to get </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/powell-tapped-second-term-fed-chair-2021-11-22/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another term</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as chair of the Federal Reserve, and that might be bad news for Bitcoin. That‚Äôs because Jerome has said that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates as soon as there is ‚Äúfull employment‚Äù to combat high inflation.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it so happens, last month the United States saw a </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/forex-markets-dollar-us-jobs-data-bank-of-england-british-pound.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">substantial increase in employment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and some are saying that this could be what the Federal Reserve needs to accelerate its tapering plans. This probably depends on what the jobs numbers look like this month.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, BTC is seen</span><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/10/08/bitcoin-not-gold-is-the-new-inflation-hedge-says-jp-morgan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an inflation hedge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by many institutional investors who might start to take profits if they believe that Jerome can tame the out of control inflation we‚Äôre seeing (which I personally doubt).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What‚Äôs fascinating though is that this rotation out of BTC can be seen on the </span><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin dominance chart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Normally, when BTC drops, dominance rises. This is because crypto investors see BTC as a ‚Äúsafe place‚Äù to park gains during crypto market downturns.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last couple of weeks however, dominance has continued to decline along with price, and most of that money seems to be flowing into ETH, </span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">whose market dominance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is on the rise. A lot of this money also seems to be pouring into Metaverse cryptocurrencies like MANA and SAND.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These two cryptocurrencies have been rallying against all odds, but they finally seem to be running out of steam. It should go without saying that you should always zoom out and look at the bigger picture.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some investors like Grayscale see even more gains for these crypto on the horizon, and I‚Äôll be talking about their </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-metaverse-is-a-1t-opportunity-after-users-increase-10x-grayscale-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">metaverse report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an upcoming video.¬†</span></p>
<p><b>üáπüá∑ </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Adoption In Turkey</span><b> üáπüá∑</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Turkish Lira lost </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkish-lira-drifts-off-record-low-erdogan-defends-policy-rate-2021-11-23/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15% of its value</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week, reaching a record low against the US dollar. This is because the Turkish central bank reduced interest rates on the orders of the president. Their rationale is that a cheap Lira means Turkey will see more exports and investment.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the same rationale used by central banks in many other countries. The problem is that this kind of monetary policy does serious damage to the purchasing power of the average person, and </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/13/turkeys-economic-turmoil-drives-bitcoin-frenzy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this is why</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Turkish citizens have been buying BTC.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turks have also been using cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services, or at least they were before the Turkish central bank </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-16/turkey-bans-cryptocurrency-payments-saying-risks-are-too-great"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned crypto payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year. It‚Äôs safe to say that the government doesn‚Äôt want competition from another currency.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what happens next in this tragic comedy? Well, if you‚Äôve been keeping up with all of my CBDC videos, you‚Äôll know that Turkey is one of the countries that has been developing a central bank digital currency or CBDC, and it looks like development </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/turkish-central-bank-taps-local-tech-firms-for-digital-currency-r-d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially began</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBDCs seem to be the only way out for governments around the world, because giving the central bank total control over the money supply makes it possible to both </span><a href="https://youtu.be/WnJbISKcsZU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create and destroy currency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Right now they can only create currency, hence all of the inflation we‚Äôre seeing.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why Turkey is so significant here is because it could foreshadow what‚Äôs coming. Inflation causes people to run to crypto. The government bans crypto as payments </span><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/China-declares-all-crypto-transactions-illegal-as-digital-yuan-nears"><span style="font-weight: 400;">or bans them completely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then, they release their CBDC. Turkey is in the second stage of this process.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is quite terrifying, but the good news is that CBDCs are nowhere close to being ready or </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/87d55cae-fe45-4041-961c-860f28e9a289"><span style="font-weight: 400;">secure enough</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for deployment. Everyone who knows how to build digital currencies is working in crypto, and crypto technology is growing faster than CBDC technology as a result.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, this means cryptocurrency will come out on top, but we will just have to wait and see. I‚Äôll keep you posted, as always.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è </span><b>NFT NGMI ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been doing NFT coverage quite a bit on the channel and have explained exactly why I think they can be so valuable. I have also told you about some of the NFT purchases I have made including some from the Mutant Ape collection I disclosed in my newsletter last week.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I was also around during the 2017 ICO boom and to me currently, it seems as if there are a lot of parallels between then and now. The NFT space has become way too saturated with some really low value collections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worse yet, there is considerably less work required to launch an NFT collection than there was to issue a token in an ICO. For many of these, the team does not need to produce a whitepaper or have any sort of investment pitch. All they have to have is a ‚Äúlimited‚Äù collection of randomly generated jpegs which sell out for millions.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To give you an idea of how little is nowadays required to make millions from an NFT collection, you can look at this </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mattlorion/video/7031265592053140741"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that I came across. Essentially, hire someone to develop a site and smart contract, hype the collection, launch a sale and bag the profit.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, NFTs are a completely different beast from a fungible ERC20 token. They are a lot less liquid and that therefore means that it may be difficult to exit your positions on them.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are countless other collections that I am seeing being shilled that are bound to be worthless - some that have even paid for star power promotions.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that you should know about the 2017 ICO boom is that over 95% of those projects that raised funding and sold tokens ended up being worthless. Either they exit-scammed, or they just cashed out and gave up, or they were hit by the SEC. But there were many bag holders that were left with nothing to show for it.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I seriously hope that we are not going through the same period now with NFTs. You can still be bullish on the potential of these tokens without throwing your money at random unknown and overhyped new mints.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To go back to the analogy of the 2017 bull market, there were plenty of ICOs that turned out to be amazing investments. Polkadot‚Äôs, Filecoin‚Äôs, Decentraland‚Äôs etc. But for every one of these there were 10 or more money grab raises.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, I recall many of my friends who wished they had just kept hold of their ETH or BTC instead of investing in ICOs back then. I can‚Äôt help but wonder whether the hype around new launches is driving people off the beaten path into dark alleys of dodgy NFTs.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are seriously considering making an investment in NFTs, then be sure that you are doing solid due diligence on the collection. If you don‚Äôt know where to start on your NFT DD, then my </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f12cCCl4tus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on it could indeed help you.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, if the NFTs that you are looking at buying are too expensive, then keep them on a watchlist. Like the crypto markets, it ebbs and flows. Don‚Äôt FOMO into an NFT for fear of missing out on the next Bored Ape or Cryptopunk.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are bullish on the NFT ecosystem then you could also consider utility tokens for those projects that are building the infrastructure for it. Utility fungible tokens are a lot more liquid and allow you to easily exit your investment should you ever want to cut losses or take profits. Examples of these include the likes of RARI, MANA, AXS, SAND etc. etc. Even if they may be overhyped, they are incredibly liquid.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, please just bear all of this in mind before you folks ape into some random collection on sale. Some NFTs are priceless, others are nothing more than worthless jpegs.¬†</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîí </span><b>Keep That Crypto Safe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I know it can be tempting to bumble onto that crypto exchange, buy that crypto and just let it sit there. However, we know that nothing really beats the benefits of self custodying that crypto.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when it comes to self custody solutions, if you want to get the best security money can buy and treat your crypto like the million dollars it could one day be, then you‚Äôll want to get yourself a hardware wallet.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how do I store my crypto? Well, I use a </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/trezor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor hardware wallet.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This device stores over 1,000 cryptos - so I imagine most of you will literally be able to store every crypto you hold on it.</span></p>

		<Title>I Wish I Knew This Before Investing in Crypto!! - December 5, 2021</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many things that I have learned since I began my crypto journey. Things that had I known about them when I first dove in, I could have saved a lot of time &amp; money.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these facts are pretty obvious to us now but not so much for those newbies jumping in the market today. However, there are some misconceptions and falsehoods that I still see people making even though they may have a lot of experience in the markets.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my video today, I take you guys through many of the things that I wish I knew before I got into crypto. Everything from balancing risk to adjusting expectations and choosing reliable sources of information. Methods of doing research and screening for coins while avoiding common and costly pitfalls.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was one of the more interesting videos I have done recently. One that brought a great deal of nostalgia to my crypto journey. So, I hope it benefits you folks. You can </span><a href="https://youtu.be/-zPyhC6TPz0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watch it here!</span></a></p>
<p><b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the massive fall that we saw on Friday / Saturday, I could not help but to buy the dip. There are many reasons as to why I think this is just a temporary shakeout (see below).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bought some more ETH, BTC &amp; MATIC with fiat. The first two are obvious given my view on the long term potential of Ethereum &amp; Bitcoin. They still are and will remain staples of my portfolio. When it comes to MATIC, the sheer development taking place on Polygon makes it hard not to be bullish and I will be doing an updated video on the project in due course.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used my UST in order to pick up some more FTM &amp; ATOM. When it comes to the former, I explained the potential I see in the project in my </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjxja5wB1UI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video on Fantom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a few weeks ago. In terms of the latter, Cosmos‚Äô SDK is the backbone of many crypto projects and as an interoperability play, it </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnpUhcuD4KA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannot be ignored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have also recently had an allocation of XDEFI released to me as I partook in a private sale a few months ago. For full transparency, I will update my portfolio as tokens like this are unlocked and vested.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updated portfolio:¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 32.10% | BTC 22.23% | SOL 13.55% | DOT 9.56% | ATOM 4.40% | FTM 2.82% | HNT 2.75% | PAXG 2.74% | RUNE 2.40% | ADA 1.99% | INJ 1.70% | MATIC 1.66% | AR 1.05% | LINK 0.78% | XDEFI 0.25%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly one month ago, Real Vision founder </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/raoul-pal-expect-the-path-of-most-pain-around-december"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raoul Pal said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ‚Äúexpect the path of most pain‚Äù in December, and here we are! The recent shakeout took a lot of people off guard, and I attribute this to the widely held belief that we will see an exact repeat of 2017.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make no mistake, although history does rhyme, it does not repeat. I knew months ago that we would either see a shorter or longer bull market, and for a long time I was leaning towards an earlier bull market. This is because of</span><a href="https://youtu.be/3cvUpAy_aXQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all the bullish updates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that were scheduled for September.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I made my recent video about swing trading however, it became clear that the charts were pointing to </span><a href="https://youtu.be/v7LyUzKWGfQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a much longer bull market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that extends into early 2022. This lengthening cycle theory is a view that many of my favorite crypto YouTubers hold, namely Benjamin Cowen and Bob Loukas.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all that said, you‚Äôre probably wondering what the hell crashed the crypto market last week. As always, it‚Äôs a mix of factors, and what they all have in common is uncertainty. As I mentioned in my emergency </span><a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM8W2H75X/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">market update on TikTok</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both the crypto market and the stock market tend to do a good job of pricing in good and bad news. It‚Äôs the uncertainty that really messes things up. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first uncertain factor is the Federal Reserve‚Äôs plans to </span><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/federal-reserve-powell-faster-tapering-timeline-market-impact"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate their taper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In case you missed the memo on that one, if the Federal Reserve tapers, interest rates go up, anyone who borrowed too much has to sell, and the market crashes as a result. The thing is that it's not known for sure whether the Federal Reserve will actually accelerate their taper.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second uncertain factor is that </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/59481063-bb0c-431a-a9e9-f77eae036e58"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damn omicron variant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some experts are saying it‚Äôs the end of the world (again), and others are saying that it‚Äôs nothing more than a bad flu. The truth is we won‚Äôt know for sure for at least another 2-3 weeks, which conveniently corresponds to the December 15th-16th date when the Federal Reserve will reveal their refined taper plans.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third uncertain factor is good old regulation. If SEC Chairman </span><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-competes-with-the-us-banking-system-says-sec-chairman"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Gensler‚Äôs comments </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">about Bitcoin being a competitor to the US banking system wasn‚Äôt bad enough, the CEOs of the largest crypto companies </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/house-committee-announces-crypto-ceos-will-testify-at-dec-8-hearing-on-digital-assets"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are scheduled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be grilled to crisp by US politicians next Wednesday. It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see what happens there, and I might just cover it in a video.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, we have liquidations from all of those traders who thought that BTC would see a clean move to 100k in December. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1467106432755675145?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned on Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, over 2 billion dollars of overleveraged longs were liquidated (had their positions automatically sold), and this caused even more liquidations, causing more liquidations, all the way down to 42k. Cascading liquidations in the crypto markets are </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzgSwgU_3G4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a massive problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that the slate is clean now - all the moonboys are out, and only the strong hands are left. BTC balances on exchanges </span><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=distribution.BalanceExchangesRelative"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to drop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, suggesting that people are holding and not selling. Best of all, crypto holders are currently </span><a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experiencing extreme fear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and you know what that means‚Ä¶ buy the f*cking dip! (</span><b>Not financial advice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üè¢ </span><b>Real Estate Developers üè¢</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that NFT mania has now started to flow over into the virtual real estate space. Last week saw more than </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/87553/metaverse-land-grab-is-here"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$100 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in virtual land sold. It seems that the vast majority of this is coming from demand within the Sandbox ecosystem.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Tuesday saw Republic Realm buy a plot of land in the Sandbox for $4.3m from Atari. They have become akin to virtual real estate barons as </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/metaverse-real-estate-piles-up-record-sales-in-sandbox-and-other-virtual-realms-11638268380"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is claimed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Republic Realm owns over 2,500 across 19 different metaverse worlds.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few days ago, someone actually paid $450k in order to buy the plot of land that exists next to Snoop Dogg‚Äôs in the Sandbox. For those that don‚Äôt know, he is building a replica of his West Coast mansion within the Sandbox.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the question is: What‚Äôs driving this hype? And is it sustainable in the long run?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well firstly, let‚Äôs look at the underlying demand and value of land. Virtual land is an NFT that I view as having some of the most extensive utility in the crypto space.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only do you have the ‚ÄúFun‚Äù aspect where you can play games &amp; socialise with others on this land in the Metaverse, but holding land also comes with additional financial benefits. It can be monetised or rented out. You can charge advertising fees for others to use your land. There are also some Metaverses (like Netvrk for example) that allow you to earn a cut of all land sales in the ecosystem. This is something I briefly talked about in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnSrjvckBTY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Metaverse this week.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then of course you have the scarcity angle. As is the case in the real world, land in the Metaverse is limited. For example, in the case of Axie Infinity, there are only 220 Genesis plots and it can be extremely difficult to get some land in these genesis mints.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, given that it is non-fungible, this land can eventually gather an identity that makes it that much more valuable. Much like the case with NFT collectibles that have rare traits, land in more favourable ‚Äúdistricts‚Äù or neighbourhoods attracts a higher sale price. This is why someone would pay $450k to ‚Äúlive‚Äù next to Snoop Dogg. But beyond that, the land itself garners value based on its ownership history. Much like the esteem of owning a famous house in the real world, this is what drives valuations in the digital one.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, while there may be some elements of hype around some of these well established projects, I happen to think that the underlying demand drivers are going to propel virtual land well into the future. I am currently working on a video that dives deeper into land ecosystems and I plan to develop our own Coin Bureau land in the metaverse.¬†</span></p>
<p><b>üî≠ Some Perspective üî≠</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto crash got you down? Join the club!¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve been in crypto for a couple of years now, and I‚Äôm still not used to these occasional downturns. What‚Äôs crazy is that even if I‚Äôm consciously fine with a 20-30 percent correction, subconsciously I can tell that I‚Äôm not (e.g. restless sleep, react more aggressively to small things that don‚Äôt matter, etc.).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve often said that when you‚Äôre in doubt, zoom out (specifically on the price). If you‚Äôve ever done this though you‚Äôll know that this doesn‚Äôt always help when your portfolio is in the negative. If this is how you‚Äôre feeling now, then you need to zoom out even further - beyond price, beyond your holdings, beyond all of the bullish and bearish announcements on the horizon.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin was created in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Since the first Bitcoin block was mined in 2009, BTC has gone from literally zero to what will inevitably be a seven figure price. Why? Because cryptocurrency is ultimately an alternative to the current financial system. It‚Äôs worth everything if it can deliver on this promise, and worth nothing if it can‚Äôt.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last two years of government stimulus have made 2008 look like child‚Äôs play. Because of the lockdowns, millions of people were sitting at home with nothing better to do than watch the news and YouTube. I reckon most of them realised how messed up our current financial system is, especially when the stock market continued to rise as they all lost their jobs.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, institutional investors who have been watching this play out for years are realising that the good times are slowly and surely coming to an end. They know the entire economy is built on debt, and there‚Äôs only so much you can borrow from the future before that monthly debt payment becomes too big to bear.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, everyone knows what we have now is unsustainable, and they are desperate for an alternative. This alternative is what Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are supposed to be, and though not all of them succeed, it‚Äôs becoming clear with each passing day that a few of them will not only succeed, but succeed (in the royal sense) their equivalents in legacy finance.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, when the crypto market crashes by 20-30 percent and you‚Äôre feeling like crap, ask yourself this: Are you going to bet on the crumbling financial infrastructure that has arguably caused most if not all of our social, environmental, or economic harm? Or are you going to bet on a revolutionary technology that is evolving faster than anyone could have possibly imagined?¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know the answer as well as I, and anyone else who has seen their purchasing power disappear, their financial freedoms taken away, and their free speech eroded by centralised social media platforms. In my mind, there is only one way out of this mess, and that‚Äôs where I am personally placing all of my bets.¬†</span></p>

		<Title>Bitcoin ETF SHAM!! Wen Spot ETF?? - December 12, 2021</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs been almost 3 months since we had that launch of those <a href="https://cbtestw.kinsta.cloud/adoption/bitcoin-etfs/">Bitcoin ETFs</a>. At the time, there was a lot of excitement around them. This led to a hype-driven rally in ETF demand which seems to have petered out now.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a pretty obvious reason for this. These ETFs were never really fit for purpose. As I explained when they were initially launched, Futures based ETFs are a substandard way to gain exposure to an underlying asset.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When they were launched, there was no way for one to realistically estimate just how much these would underperform the spot market. However, after at least three months of public trading, we have some solid data.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, I take a deep dive back into those ETFs. I analyse some data around their price performance and cost. I also examine exactly where the ETF applications are now and where they could be going.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I still maintain that we are likely to see a spot instrument in 2022 - however, that is contingent on a few factors that people need to be paying attention to.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All covered in my video which you can </span><a href="https://youtu.be/kc-JuXWDY5w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watch here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span>

<b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes to the portfolio this week folks. I‚Äôm currently happy with the general allocation and don‚Äôt think that there are any really attractive opportunities at this time.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, I am looking to allocate a portion of my portfolio to GameFi / Metaverse plays - either as NFTs or utility tokens. There are a number of exciting projects I am exploring and I have an upcoming video on Metaverse land which was a blast to work on.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I will of course keep you fully updated with my moves in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram Channel.¬†</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 32.42% | BTC 23.05% | SOL 12.61% | DOT 9.89% | ATOM 4.32% | PAXG 2.84% | FTM 2.77% | HNT 2.61% | RUNE 2.12% | ADA 2.06% | MATIC 1.72% | INJ 1.56% | AR 0.97% | LINK 0.83% | XDEFI 0.22%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In last week‚Äôs</span><a href="https://youtu.be/XK2t45fy79w"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crypto review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I mentioned that we would probably drop down to around 46k this week, and once again my prediction came true. The question is what comes next?¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I get into that I want to dispel all the FUD that‚Äôs been flying around about this bull market being over.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôll start by saying that there‚Äôs no predicting where prices will go next, and everything you read here could be subject to change. That said, there‚Äôs a couple of indicators that suggest that this is nothing more than a huge fake out before the final run up. The first indicator is the balance of <a href="https://cbtestw.kinsta.cloud/review/ftx-exchange/">BTC on exchanges</a>, which recently fell to </span><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-exchange-balance-hits-three-year-low"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a three year low.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I‚Äôve mentioned many times before, when BTC balances on exchanges are dropping, it means people are, on average, buying and holding, and not selling. Logically, if this was the end of the bull run, we wouldn‚Äôt see this kind of dip buying behavior. The second indicator is </span><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin dominance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which briefly dropped below 40% last week.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the crypto market is crashing, there‚Äôs a tendency for investors to move their altcoin gains into BTC. This is because BTC is seen as the ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù in the crypto market. Bitcoin dominance plays a role in the crypto </span><a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fear and greed index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where a higher Bitcoin dominance means more fear.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What‚Äôs interesting is that Bitcoin dominance is dropping while the crypto market drops, despite the fact that we (retail investors) are obviously feeling fearful at the moment. This suggests that the smart money knows that a big move is coming for altcoins, and given that </span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum dominance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is rising as Bitcoin dominance falls, it looks like the smart money is betting on ETH.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the introduction of Proof of Stake, the speculation that a futures backed Ethereum ETF could be coming is probably what‚Äôs causing this effect. The recent introduction of </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cme-group-introduces-micro-ether-161124478.html#:~:text=The%20Chicago%20Mercantile%20Exchange%20(CME,1%2F10%20of%20one%20ETH."><span style="font-weight: 400;">micro Ether futures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the CME group is evidence that there is huge demand for an Ethereum futures ETF, and I reckon the institutions are going to get what they want.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôm not sure when an Ethereum futures ETF will come, but one thing‚Äôs for sure: all of the FUD and macro factors that kept the crypto market down last week are in the past (be it </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/1-1b-in-bitcoin-options-expire-on-friday-but-data-points-to-a-sub-55k-btc-price"><span style="font-weight: 400;">options expiries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/evergrande-defaults-for-first-time-as-china-debt-strains-spread"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evergrande default</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fears; more about that in tomorrow‚Äôs crypto review). From where I‚Äôm standing, it looks like we‚Äôre going to have a green week, but don‚Äôt expect any fireworks.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only thing I see on the horizon that could drag the market down are the fears of an accelerated taper by the Federal Reserve in response to the </span><a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/12/10/inflation-rate-consumer-prices-rose-6-8-annually-november/6455689001/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">record inflation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported on Friday for the United States. Judging by how the stock market reacted to this news though (it went up), I think everyone knows that the Federal Reserve can‚Äôt risk doing that just yet.¬†</span>

<b>ü§î </b><b>Solana Woes</b> <b>ü§î</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you guys can see, I hold a decent portion of my portfolio in SOL. However, it‚Äôs important for one to constantly test their investment thesis, especially when negative news comes to light.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all heard by now, it sounds like Solana suffered </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-reportedly-hit-by-ddos-attack-but-network-remains-online"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another DDoS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attack that may or may not have temporarily taken down it‚Äôs blockchain. For those unfamiliar, DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Dervice, and it essentially involves spamming a website, server, or in this case a blockchain, with requests, messages, or transactions until it goes down.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming Solana did in fact go down, it would be the third outage Solana has experienced since its main net launched in March last year. The </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-and-arbitrum-knocked-offline-while-ethereum-evades-attack"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous outage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> occurred in September, and it looks like the same person who took down Solana also took down Ethereum‚Äôs Arbitrum, and even tried to take down Ethereum - though this attempt was unsuccessful.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre familiar with Solana or watched </span><a href="https://youtu.be/enAoz-87D7A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my most recent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Solana update, you‚Äôll know that Solana is somewhat centralized. This is because Solana‚Äôs blockchain consists of clusters of up to 150 validator nodes, and some believe that the actual size of Solana‚Äôs clusters is much smaller than that. This is one of the reasons why Solana can handle up to 50 thousand transactions per second, and another reason is Solana‚Äôs proof of stake consensus mechanism.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to most other PoS cryptocurrencies, Solana uses a technology called Proof of History which basically timestamps transactions. Note that </span><a href="https://docs.solana.com/cluster/synchronization#relationship-to-consensus-mechanisms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PoH is NOT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a consensus mechanism. It‚Äôs just a part of Solana‚Äôs PoS consensus.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyways, this timestamping of transactions basically lets validator nodes crank out as many transactions as their computers allow them to since these transactions can be easily ordered when they‚Äôre added to a block after the fact. It‚Äôs a bit more complicated than this, but let‚Äôs roll with it to keep things simple.¬†¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only problem with this approach is that timestamping transactions before they‚Äôre actually put into a block makes it possible for someone to attack the validator who is supposed to put that transaction into a block. When you combine this with the relatively small number of validators in a Solana cluster, it makes such an attack that much more doable, as explained </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Justin_Bons/status/1469375118036160529?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in this thread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this mean that Solana is a scam or a ‚Äúbad faith creation‚Äù as some have implied? No. Besides the fact that all of this stuff is clearly detailed in Solana‚Äôs documentation, Solana itself is still </span><a href="https://solanabeach.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">technically in beta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There‚Äôs still lots of development that needs to be done, and I‚Äôm sure these are just one of many issues that still need to be addressed behind the scenes prior to alpha.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, Solana is backed by some of the biggest names in cryptocurrency, and SOL seems to be a favorite among institutional investors. As I mentioned in my video about the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/nmQVO10Tl6s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most funded crypto projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> post ICO, Solana raised more than half a billion dollars from institutional investors in the first half of this year alone, and it has raised millions more since then.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, who‚Äôs right? The handful of religious anti-Solana investors screaming FUD when something goes wrong with Solana, or the institutions who are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Solana? You tell me.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If I had my tinfoil hat, I‚Äôd tell you that FUD is exactly what the institutions buying Grayscale‚Äôs </span><a href="https://grayscale.com/products/grayscale-solana-trust/?utm_source=globe-newswire&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=product-sol&amp;utm_content=2021-11-30_product-launch-sol&amp;utm_term=SOL"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently released</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Solana trust want.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said all of this, centralisation woes is not something that only blockchains have to deal with...</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üè¢ </span><b>Our Centralised World üè¢</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, something happens that just makes me realise how damn centralised internet infrastructure is. This week it was the widespread outages that we saw at AWS. This was massive and didn‚Äôt only severely impact Amazon but also all the </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/amazon-outage-sparks-anger-as-fridges-stop-people-locked-out"><span style="font-weight: 400;">millions of devices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and services that rely on AWS‚Äô hosting infrastructure.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of those services that were interrupted also included the likes of Coinbase, Robinhood and Binance.us. This of course impacted on the ability of their users to, quite ironically, buy decentralised assets.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, these are centralised exchanges, but the outage even impacted decentralised exchanges. These include the likes of dYdX that went down due to the outage. This is despite the fact that all transactions are handled on a decentralised blockchain. That‚Äôs because nearly all Defi protocols do rely on some form of centralised internet infrastructure in some form or another.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is something that I have talked about in the past - specifically as it </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/992"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relates to Uniswap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Centralisation of internet infrastructure is not only a risk when it comes to points of failure, but also </span><b><i>points of pressure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as Web 3.0 Dapps have to rely on the DNS system or front-end hosting, they are susceptible to these large providers in the space.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why for the Defi revolution to be truly decentralised, we have to also back those projects and initiatives that are decentralising storage. There are quite a few projects out there that do this but some well known examples include:¬†</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Arweave:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Platform that is trying to develop a platform of immutable and infinite storage. The protocol matches people who have hard drive space with those that are looking to store said data. Arweave‚Äôs platform is actually where Solana stores it‚Äôs blockchain data and I have covered the project in depth </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKFhHL1geVw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a video.¬†</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Filecoin:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Decentralised storage protocol that is built on the back of IPFS. This project completed one of the largest ICOs back in 2017 and had its mainnet go live towards the end of last year. FIL has been a pretty poor performer in general but that does not detract from the amazing potential of IPFS.¬†</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sia</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Distributed cloud storage network that acts as a secure and trustless marketplace for storage. This is one of the oldest blockchain storage plays out there and has fallen out of favour of late - but a pioneer nonetheless.¬†</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>ENS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: While not a ‚Äústorage‚Äù solution, the Ethereum Name Service (and similar blockchain based domains) could be the future solution for the centralised DNS system. There are a number of native blockchains that already support human readable addresses. If these could be combined with decentralised storage solutions for hosting, it's a decentralisation bonanza.¬†</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am of course under no illusions that these data solutions are anywhere close to being fit for purpose at a mass scale. It is still a few years before we could start seeing dApps using decentralised hosting or domains.¬†¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But the point is that there are potential solutions underway that could free us from these modern day data Robber Barons.¬†</span>

		<Title><![CDATA[You're Being Lied To!! Ultimate SCAM! - December 19, 2021]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 2 weeks ago, we saw the highest CPI inflation print in 40 years. It was coming in hot at over 6.8%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, do you really believe that? Do you really believe it‚Äôs ‚Äúonly‚Äù up 6.8% at a time when home prices are up 15%, gas is up 61% and beef is up 20%?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you really trust that the statisticians and data scientists in the government are calculating your cost of living correctly when you see prices up way more than the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù figures?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are skeptical, then you have a right to be‚Ä¶¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is that the CPI inflation rate that so many people place importance on, could be severely undercounting the actual inflation rate. Some estimates have it undershooting the mark by as much as 10% or more.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs actually one of the biggest financial ruses hidden in plain sight. And in my video today, I am going to show you exactly why. From methods of determining the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù consumer basket, to the way in which they adjust averages, from assumptions around substitution to methods of collection. It‚Äôs flawed to the core (no pun intended).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/iJTUVPaNJ04"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here</span></a></p>
<p><b>üìä Portfolio Update üìä</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still no changes to the portfolio this week. I have, however, moved over a bunch of stablecoin that I had been lending out back into my main portfolio (UST &amp; USDC). This will remain as dry powder should the best entry opportunities come my way.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to assets that are on my radar, I am particularly interested in Land tokens &amp; virtual real estate. I talked more about this in a recent </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0yOHkzFn9k"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video of mine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is mainly because of the utility that could come from building a potential Coin Bureau University in the Metaverse for example. Perhaps a project for 2022 üòâ</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now though, the portfolio is:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 30.95% | BTC 21.65% | SOL 13.36% | DOT 8.77% | ATOM 4.01% | HNT 2.85% | PAXG 2.80% | FTM 2.64% | UST 1.99% | RUNE 1.92% | ADA 1.92% | MATIC 1.80% | USDC 1.68% | INJ 1.37% | AR 1.27% | LINK 0.82% | XDEFI 0.21%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs been another tough week in the crypto market, and that‚Äôs for one reason: macro economics, AKA big picture stuff. Before I break down each factor affecting the crypto market, here‚Äôs a quick pro tip for you: if you see that the stock market </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/stocks-slide-safe-havens-gain-omicron-worries-weigh-2021-12-17/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is crashing too</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it‚Äôs safe to assume that whatever is causing the crypto crash is not specific to crypto.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first macro factor at play last week was the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision to reduce its money printing because of all the inflation it‚Äôs been causing. Originally, the Federal Reserve was going to do this over an 8 month period, but following record inflation numbers for November they will be doing it over </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/585973-fed-to-speed-up-taper-projects-three-rate-hikes-in-2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a four month period</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with the first interest rate increase scheduled for 2022.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I‚Äôve mentioned many times before, reducing asset purchases will increase interest rates which will have big ripple effects throughout the economy. What‚Äôs interesting is that both the crypto market and the stock market rallied after the announcement, suggesting it was </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/15/bitcoins-decline-suggests-feds-hawkish-policy-shift-is-priced-in/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already priced in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I will be doing a video on the impact of rate hikes next year so keep your eyes peeled for that.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second macro factor at play seems to be the delay of the 3 trillion dollar Build Back Better bill which was expected to be passed by the end of the year. It‚Äôs now looking like it won‚Äôt be passed until </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/586241-biden-hints-build-back-better-talks-could-slip-into-new-year"><span style="font-weight: 400;">early next year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What‚Äôs interesting is that this seems to be the announcement that caused the crypto market and the stock market to dip again late last week.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes a lot of sense because even though that 3 trillion dollars is supposed to be spent on ‚Äúhuman infrastructure‚Äù, I reckon a decent chunk of this de facto stimulus will </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/billionaire-wealth-covid-pandemic-12-trillion-jeff-bezos-wealth-tax/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">somehow end up on Wall Street</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even just a small portion of that massive money pile would probably be enough to prop up the markets in the absence of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs constant asset purchases.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the only crypto specific factors that I could find for the dip we saw late last week was the SEC‚Äôs decision to delay two spot </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-delays-decisions-on-bitwise-and-grayscale-s-bitcoin-etfs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin ETF applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including one by Grayscale. The decision dates have been pushed back to February next year, so mark your calendars. If you‚Äôre wondering why a spot Bitcoin ETF is so important, you need to watch </span><a href="https://youtu.be/kc-JuXWDY5w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ASAP.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another crypto specific factor that could be playing a role is Huobi, one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges among Chinese crypto investors. Huobi </span><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.amp/business/huobi-will-not-serve-chinese-users"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced in September </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that it will stop onboarding new Chinese users and boot existing users off the platform by December 31st. As that date approaches, it‚Äôs possible that some investors are cashing out, crashing prices.¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôll be doing a deeper dive into what comes next for the crypto market in tomorrow‚Äôs weekly crypto review, so keep your eyes peeled. Spoiler: it‚Äôs looking pretty damn good üòâ</span></p>
<p><b>üßÉ</b> <b>Juicy Survey</b> <b>üßÉ</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week I finally managed to finish reading that Messari crypto forecast report (video dropping in the next few days). It was super insightful and that‚Äôs because I am keen to see what some of the biggest crypto companies have to say about the crypto market next year. The latest predictions I managed to pull up come from the one and only Andreesen Horowitz AKA a16z which is basically the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/4xGoI370bVo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest VC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in crypto.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A16z‚Äôs </span><a href="https://youtu.be/4xGoI370bVo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 crypto predictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are based on a survey of over 2,200 voters in the United states, and it concerns crypto politics. It starts off by saying that 20% of Americans hold cryptocurrency, and nearly 80% of voters would vote for a pro crypto politician over an anti-crypto politician. I guess </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1471100424778358790?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Warren</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be losing her podium soon enough then, and good riddance!¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyways, the key takeaways from a16z‚Äôs survey are that basically everyone, regardless of their age, race, gender, or political affiliation, is pro crypto, so much so that 22% said that crypto attitudes of their constituents will play a ‚Äúsignificant role‚Äù in how they vote during the </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/12/politics/midterm-election-2022-republican-wave/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 midterm elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, 80% of Americans have a favourable view of cryptocurrency. This is because they see the value in controlling their own data, preserving privacy, protecting against totalitarian governments, and </span><a href="https://youtu.be/MA2HJ0xew2Q"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self custody</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> / control of their own assets. Not surprisingly then, 70% believe that the US government should understand crypto before it starts to regulate it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statistic that stuck out to me the most was that almost three quarters of those surveyed said they had done their research before buying. I‚Äôm a bit skeptical of this because there are lots of surveys which suggest the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/04/survey-finds-one-third-of-crypto-buyers-dont-know-what-theyre-doing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exact opposite</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That said, the Coin Bureau has grown exponentially over the last year, and I reckon that‚Äôs going to result in some fairly educated folks! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre wondering where the prediction is in all of this, it‚Äôs basically that pro-crypto politicians will be the ones who win in next year‚Äôs US elections. There seem to be a lot of them on both sides of the aisle these days, but I can‚Äôt help but notice that Democrats seem to have a deeper desire for control when it comes to crypto regulations. Watch </span><a href="https://youtu.be/wdcEtsZyfms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and let me know what you think.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, it‚Äôs clear that we‚Äôre going to see some reasonable crypto regulations come around. Let‚Äôs just hope that it‚Äôs not too late by the time they do‚Ä¶¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üñº </span><b>Institutional NFT Frenzy üñº</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, I talked about the increasing institutional trend towards NFT assets. As I alluded to in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1388"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telegram post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the most interesting of these was the BitWise NFT Index Fund. This is a collective investment vehicle that holds NFTs from the 10 most valuable NFT collections and you can read more about the mechanics in this </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan/status/1471489244824674306"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tweet thread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs a great concept that will allow institutions and ‚Äúaccredited‚Äù investors exposure to these collections in a diversified manner. Moreover, it takes away some of the risks that these guys would have to face should they buy and store NFTs individually.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This move by Bitwise is not the first. There are a number of other moves being made by institutions including:¬†¬†</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Arca: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The asset manager, which has an AuM of $500m </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/24/crypto-investment-firm-arca-launches-30m-fund-dedicated-to-nfts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is launching</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a $30m fund focused on investing in NFT assets. They have already managed to raise $11.4m from 68 investors. It will invest in assets including in-game items, collectibles, art &amp; virtual real estate.¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Osprey Funds</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The Crypto investment firm </span><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/124840/crypto-asset-manager-plans-to-raise-hundreds-of-millions-to-actively-invest-in-nfts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is launching</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a new entity called ‚ÄúOsprey Alpha LLC‚Äù that will offer institutional investors exposure to NFTs. According to Osprey Funds CEO, they estimate that over time these funds could see hundreds of millions of dollars spread across them.¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Meta4 Capital:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> An NFT exclusive fund that is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/a-nine-figure-fund-for-jpgs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">looking to raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $100m from a16z. They have already invested in a number of rare NFTs including punks &amp; Apes.¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Defiance ETFs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A new fund to </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-02/defiance-launches-nft-etf-as-crypto-workaround-funds-proliferate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">track the performance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of NFT assets and infrastructure providers.¬†</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are of course many others that I have not mentioned here. The point is that in 2022, I think there will be a flood of capital into this space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is actually a really bullish sign for NFT assets in my opinion - even more so than when they first started moving into cryptocurrencies in 2019 / 2020.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because of the fact that NFTs cannot be denominated the same way that fungible tokens can. It‚Äôs a lot harder to fractionalise these assets. This is especially the case with the PFP NFTs. Yes, there are platforms that are looking to tokenise NFTs but that would produce tricky questions around securities. In fact, SEC commissioner, Hector Peirce, has </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/62989/sec-hester-peirce-nfts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that fractionalised NFTs could be considered securities.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only other options are these collective vehicles like Bitwise that will allow accredited investors to buy a stake in a fund that holds these assets. However, it still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that these NFTs cannot be split among funds like you can easily do with fungible crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, this inherent quality of a NFT means that the pressures of growing demand and a limited supply is likely to have that much more of an impact on the price. This is especially the case for those NFT collections in the </span><a href="https://prnt.sc/23gtii4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äúblue chip‚Äù bucket.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we roll into 2022, I will be looking to make more investments in the space and will of course keep you guys constantly updated with these moves.¬†</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, you can do that manually. But most people I know just don‚Äôt have the time to check, reculalate and buy / sell every single day. This can then lead to over / underweight portfolios that are skewed one way or another.</span></p>

		<Title>Rates Going Up! Crypto Crash?? - December 26, 2021</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 2 weeks ago, the Fed held its December FOMC meeting. This was one of the most anticipated meetings of the year as it would provide guidance about how the Fed would shape monetary policy in 2021.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As was widely expected, the Fed said that they would be doubling the rate of their taper. This would therefore move the timeline forward for the end of the program and the beginning of the rate hiking cycle. At least half of the Fed officials think that we will see at least 3 rate hikes next year.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, there are many that think this could lead to an end of this stock market rally. However, the main question is what impact will it have on the crypto markets?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, one of the most striking themes that we have seen over the past 2 years is that Bitcoin has almost moved in lockstep with the equity markets. If there is a crash that many are expecting, is Bitcoin likely to follow?¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is exactly what I explore in my video today. I take a look at what the interest rate increases mean and how they are likely to play out for the markets.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnZYRhjQq4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here.</span></a></p>
<p><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite a few changes this week. Firstly, as mentioned in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a few days ago, I have added YGG (Yield Guild Games). I explained why I picked it up in the </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1407"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aforementioned post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but it‚Äôs mainly because I am bullish on Play-To-Earn gaming guilds especially those in regions like South East Asia. I used some of my free USDC to pick this up.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I decided to use the remaining USDC as well as some PAXG in order to buy some more MATIC. I have become increasingly bullish on Polygon of late and you can find out why by </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OECcDsmmhRg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a few weeks back.¬†¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we are on the topic of my portfolio, you guys may be interested </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhY1Hl-D3jI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I did on Friday. It takes you through the evolution of my portfolio over the year and my strategy for 2021¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 28.91% | BTC 20.76% | SOL 12.96% | DOT 9.33% | ATOM 4.94% | FTM 3.85% | HNT 2.98% | PAXG 2.82% | MATIC 2.75% | RUNE 2.13% | ADA 1.95% | UST 1.80% | INJ 1.35% | AR 1.29% | YGG 1.10% | LINK 0.84% | XDEFI 0.22%</span></p>
<p><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that I am investing in more NFT assets, I am going to track this as a separate portfolio from the main one. The % share of the portfolio for these NFTs will be based on the floor price of the collection.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of additions to the portfolio this week, I have finally decided to pick up a Meebit. You can see exactly which one I bought and my rationale behind it in my Telegram </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">post here.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I have also bought SPACE NFTs in the Big Time Gaming ecosystem but these will only be added once they are unlocked.¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current portfolio is:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 83.50% | Meebit 16.50%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you surprised that the market is up this week? If you are, that might be because you didn‚Äôt watch last week‚Äôs </span><a href="https://youtu.be/N0optxA36Rw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until the end. I noticed that there was a bullish divergence between BTC price and RSI on the daily, a divergence that looks almost identical to the one we saw in late September before a massive rally. I said this suggested a recovery was imminent. Here we are!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not just the technicals either. The balance of BTC on exchanges continued to drop even as prices did, which means that people are buying the dip and HODLing, not selling. However, it looks like this trend is </span><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=distribution.BalanceExchangesRelative&amp;s=1606247089&amp;u=1640390400&amp;zoom="><span style="font-weight: 400;">starting to reverse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will know for sure in the next week or two. If BTC does start flowing back into exchanges, it could be a sign that we‚Äôre approaching the final peak.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another indicator I‚Äôve been paying attention to is </span><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin dominance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which has been holding steady (for the most part). I take it as a sign that the market still isn‚Äôt 100% sure whether it‚Äôs headed higher or lower. Note that as we approach the top, we will see Bitcoin dominance drop like a rock when everyone rotates into altcoins for massive gains.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of what will cause this final rally, I‚Äôve mentioned many times that I think it will be the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. This is because the approval of the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/17/worlds-largest-futures-exchange-set-to-launch-bitcoin-futures-sunday-night.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CME Bitcoin futures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017¬† market the top of the bull market for BTC. In the month or so that followed, altcoins went ballistic before the entire crypto market collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What‚Äôs interesting is that the SEC had rejected almost every Bitcoin spot ETF that was on the table except for those submitted by </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-delays-decisions-on-bitwise-and-grayscale-s-bitcoin-etfs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grayscale and Bitwise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The fact the SEC didn‚Äôt reject these with all the others suggests one of them might just be approved. The SEC has delayed their decision on these two spot Bitcoin ETF applications to early February.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming the SEC does approve a Bitcoin spot ETF at that time, here‚Äôs what I think will happen. First, BTC will hit its final high for this bull market. Second, money will move into altcoins for a month, creating all time highs for many of them as well. Then, the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in March leading to a predictable fall in ‚Äúrisk on‚Äù assets. More on that in my</span> <a href="https://youtu.be/DcnZYRhjQq4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video for today</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üñº </span><b>The Great Web3 Debate üñº</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you guys have been keeping up with Crypto Twitter recently, you will have heard about the spat that Jack Dorsey was getting into with many in the Web3 community. More specifically, he took aim at the VCs funding these projects in </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this tweet.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jack has the view that Venture Capitalists and their Limited Partners ‚Äúown‚Äù the space.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tweet was a grenade on CT that blew up and started a strong discussion around Web3, Bitcoin and VCs role in crypto. It even led to Mark Andreessen (founder of a16z) </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473725424387694601"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blocking Jack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do I think about this debate? Well, I see what he‚Äôs getting at, but I don‚Äôt agree.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, Web3 platforms are built on a decentralised blockchain. Although VCs may hold tokens in the same platform / protocol, they do not own the platform itself. They cannot censure or restrict use of the platform. Unlike with Web2 companies, they don‚Äôt control API endpoints which external developers are given permission to use. Smart contracts on a blockchain are permissionless and </span><b>anyone</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can use it. The amount of open source development that can proliferate in Web3 cannot be underestimated.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web3 allows all of those participants to share in the growth and adoption of the protocol by owning the native tokens. Through Decentralised Governance, these holders are also able to shape the future and development of the platform. This is something that is the antithesis of Web2. Moreover, when you own a private key to your wallet, you have complete control over the funds on said protocol. Only you own it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said all of this, there are grains of truth to Jack‚Äôs statement. There is a lot of VC money in these Web3 companies. They get seed stage access to the tokens and this means that they control a lot of the tokens. They are also able to participate in those governance votes which means that they could have an outsized influence on decisions. I have also seen a number of other questionable proposals getting voted through on other platforms.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, there is the concern among many that these VCs use retail investors as ‚ÄúExit Liquidity‚Äù and dump their seed stage tokens on the downstream investors. This has happened on a number of projects in the past.¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, that is why projects should opt for strict vesting schedules. Those that ensure that the early stage investors cannot just dump tokens on the market. This is why I always look at these vesting schedules when doing research on a vid. From the conversations we have had with project teams more recently, the last investor that they want is someone that is looking to dump on unlocks. They know that an investor must bring more than money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, it doesn‚Äôt really benefit the VC to dump either. Think about it from the perspective of long term wealth generation. If they dump their tokens and crash the price, the project is likely to die. The potential upside over the longer term is destroyed in that simple action. They are better served when they hold and vote in ways that prolong the value and use cases of the protocol in question.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my view, the real barrier here for the more equitable distribution of wealth in Web3 is </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1474131976990953473?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">securities laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When these projects are raising seed funding, they are not allowed to go to retail lest they get hit with an SEC fine. Hence, they are ‚Äúforced‚Äù to raise from these ‚Äúaccredited‚Äù investors who happen to be the VCs and HNWs.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be interesting to see how the space would evolve should these laws be re-evaluated‚Ä¶¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One more thing that I will add though, is that perhaps the reason Jack has this view about VCs is because he knows them very well. Twitter raised funding from them as they grew and maybe the reason that he is stating this, is because of that experience. He even </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473142409135595520"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted as much.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It would be fascinating to know more about the role they played in shaping Twitter as it is today ü§î</span></p>
<p><b>üîö</b> <b>End Game of Crypto Investing</b> <b>üîö</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you watched </span><a href="https://youtu.be/hXp32pWkwqI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my recent video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Messari‚Äôs cryptocurrency predictions for 2022, you‚Äôll remember the last section of the report was basically life advice from Messari founder and CEO Ryan Selkis. This section was packed with links to other insightful posts that I didn‚Äôt have the time to talk about in the video, and I want to talk about a couple of them here.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There‚Äôs a concept called ‚ÄòThe Tail End‚Äô which was coined by author Tim Urban in a 2015 </span><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wait-but-who"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The TLDR is that there is a high likelihood that you are on the tail end of most of the relationships in your life, especially if you‚Äôre close to my age. Put simply, you have already spent most of the time with your friends and family as a percentage of the total time you had together.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The takeaway is that you should do your best to cherish the limited time you have left, and this ties into another concept Ryan mentioned in the Messari report. In a </span><a href="https://pomp.substack.com/p/time-billionaire"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 podcast </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with Tim Ferris, East Rock Capital co-founder Graham Duncan coined the term ‚Äòtime billionaire‚Äô when he realised that a million seconds is 11 days and a billion seconds is slightly over 31 years.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The takeaway here is that although many of us aren‚Äôt billionaires in money terms, we are billionaires in time terms, and time is much more valuable than money. After all, what‚Äôs the point in having money if you don‚Äôt have the time to spend it? And what‚Äôs the point in having time if you have nobody to share that time with?¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the part of the wealth equation that we tend to forget about when it comes to crypto investing. It‚Äôs not about the money. It‚Äôs about the time. And it‚Äôs not even about the time. It‚Äôs about the time you spend with the people that matter to you.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I reckon this is the real endgame of crypto investing: buying the time you need to make the most of the tail end of your relationships.¬†</span></p>

		<Title>My 2022 Predictions!! Top 10 List!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy New Year!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been a lot of predictions made over the past few weeks. Predictions about prices, events and the general direction of crypto. I have even gone over some of these predictions in recent videos.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is one thing that is missing and that‚Äôs my personal predictions!¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have quite a few to make. These range from where we can see the markets heading, which themes are likely to dominate and what threats we could face.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you guys want to start 2022 off with a bang, then </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this video</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be one of the first you watch.¬†</span></p>
<p><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes to the main portfolio this week folks. Happy with the allocation so far. Yet, as mentioned, I am looking to pick up a few more gaming &amp; metaverse plays in the next few weeks. Follow my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for these live updates.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 27.88% | BTC 20.53% | SOL 12.11% | DOT 9.67% | ATOM 5.81% | FTM 4.32% | HNT 3.26% | PAXG 2.95% | MATIC 2.59% | RUNE 2.21% | ADA 1.94% | UST 1.87% | AR 1.38% | INJ 1.34% | YGG 1.07% | LINK 0.83% | XDEFI 0.25%</span></p>
<p><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No additional NFT purchases this week. Although the crazy performance in my Mutant Apes means that they make up a much larger proportion of my portfolio now.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 93.59% | Meebit 6.41%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week I don‚Äôt get to brag about the prediction I made in last week‚Äôs </span><a href="https://youtu.be/S1YABU0ssog"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because it looks like I was wrong. I predicted that we‚Äôd see an inverse head and shoulders pattern that would take BTC to the 55k range, and though we did see a slight pump to 50k, we fell back down shortly afterwards. Here‚Äôs why I think that happened.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it‚Äôs the holidays. This means there aren‚Äôt all that many people trading and that means trading volume is low. When trading volume is low, prices tend to be more volatile, and the low balance of BTC on exchanges adds fuel to the fire. It looks like some whales took this opportunity to create a dip to buy. Case and point, check out </span><a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1476748846118096912?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this massive purchase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 9900 BTC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, options expire. December 31st saw over </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-s-6-1-billion-options-expiry-was-not-enough-to-break-the-bearish-sentiment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 billion dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in BItcoin options expiries. As I‚Äôve mentioned many times before, options expiries tend to have a large impact on the spot markets. This is because of all the market makers adjusting their positions and in this case most options traders were positioned bullish.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this fact, it‚Äôs surprising that BTC didn‚Äôt pump more than it did, and this seems to be because of the third factor: Chinese users of cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance, Huobi, and Kucoin are among the many crypto exchanges that announced they </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-halt-chinese-yuan-trading-amid-beijings-crypto-crackdown-2021-10-13/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">would be restricting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or banning Chinese users by December 31st. This likely caused a lot of selling on that date.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, it looks like some of the FATF‚Äôs dreaded crypto ‚Äúrecommendations‚Äù are starting to be enforced in </span><a href="http://to-follow-coinone-in-verifying-private-wallets"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some countries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and by some </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinone-will-stop-withdrawals-to-unverified-external-wallets"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In this case, that‚Äôs identifying any ‚Äúunverified‚Äù external wallets. This is one of the more severe ‚Äúrecommendations‚Äù, and you can learn about it and all the others coming down the pipe by watching </span><a href="https://youtu.be/nFSOfkalDK4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that it‚Äôs going to take some time for other countries and crypto companies to start enforcing the FATF‚Äôs dystopian recommendations. The first movers are always the companies and countries with the </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/09/17/south-korea-crypto-exchange-shut-down-bitcoin-regulation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most aggressive regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so take this as a sign of things to come rather than a sign that the end is nigh.¬†</span></p>
<p><b>üîö</b> <b>Upcoming Crypto Milestones </b><b>üîö</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the holidays I got a lot of questions from friends and family about what the crypto market will look like in 2022. In case it wasn‚Äôt clear by now, I‚Äôm pretty confident we‚Äôre finally going to see </span><a href="https://youtu.be/W5MCQJR-yWA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the blow off top</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of this bull market by the end of the first quarter. This is mainly because almost every major crypto project has an upcoming milestone that‚Äôs expected to occur by then.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with Bitcoin, I really think we‚Äôre going to see one of those </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-delays-decisions-on-bitwise-and-grayscale-s-bitcoin-etfs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently delayed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spot Bitcoin ETF applications approved. I‚Äôm even more convinced now that the SEC has hired </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/30/sec-chair-gary-gensler-hires-senate-banking-aide-to-advise-on-crypto-policy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a crypto advisor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help Gary Gensler sort things out. This could turn out to be bad news, but if I was in Gary‚Äôs shoes, I would also like to have a fall guy to blame in case a spot Bitcoin ETF goes badly.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up is Ethereum, which is in its </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/21/ethereum-launches-kintsugi-public-testnet-ahead-of-move-to-proof-of-stake/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">final stages of testing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the rollout of Ethereum 2.0. No exact dates have been provided there, but development has apparently been going smoothly even since </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/06/eth-20-staking-platform-discovers-multimillion-dollar-bug-in-rivals-code/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a few bugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were discovered in the fall. These delayed The Merge which was expected to occur as early as the end of 2021. A merge by March seems plausible at this point.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardano is another cryptocurrency that could see some fireworks in the next few months. Although ADA hasn‚Äôt performed all that well recently, a few of Cardano‚Äôs </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Q0KhW8ftm90"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most promising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dApps are on the cusp of deployment. These should create significant demand for ADA. Cardano also has another hard fork combinator event scheduled for February which I‚Äôll explain later this week.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Polkadot is expected to run </span><a href="https://parachains.info/auctions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another 5 rounds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Parachain slot auctions between now and March 10th. Besides the demand for DOT these could create, each auction locks up DOT, effectively taking it out of circulation. As basic economics dictates, the less of something you have, the more its value rises assuming demand stays the same.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last crypto milestone I want to mention here is actually Litecoin‚Äôs upcoming Mimblewimble implementation. For those who don‚Äôt know, Mimblewimble is basically a privacy preserving layer 2 for Litecoin. If successful, this could put LTC in competition with other privacy coins, especially since you can find LTC almost anywhere you can find BTC. Current ETA is the </span><a href="https://wenmweb.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">end of January</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üó≥ </span><b>The DAO Future üó≥</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lately, I have become fascinated with the concept of DAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations. It‚Äôs a topic I have </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFEXFvCFywc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">touched on before</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and something that I talked about in my recent New Year‚Äôs Resolution video on </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Q_9f455xE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my clips channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is, I really think that 2022 could be a year for DAOs to become serious business in the crypto space. This is something that Ryan Selkis at Messari also predicted in his </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXp32pWkwqI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 crypto report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, Messari have even put their money where their mouth is with a new governance platform called </span><a href="https://messari.io/governor/what-is-governor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúGovernor‚Äù</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because of two major needs for these organisations.¬†</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralised governance of Open Source protocols</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community investing in a digital age¬†</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to 1, we are likely to see way more DeFi projects and protocols integrate these DAOs into their structure. This is because of the pressing need to remove all appearances of centralised control. The more distributed the decision making, the less the regulators are able to apply pressure on one particular individual or company.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If 2021 has taught us anything, it‚Äôs that the SEC and other regulators definitely have their sites on Defi. We have also learned that these Decentralised Finance protocols are not always that ‚Äúdecentralised‚Äù. Getting to that benchmark of ‚Äúsufficiently‚Äù decentralised is key for the protocol to fully survive. In fact, the SEC has </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that those networks that are sufficiently decentralised are less likely to be a security. This is perhaps the reason that Ethereum never got hit by the SEC but companies like Ripple have.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is that DAO structures are going to be pivotal for the DeFi protocols that we love to reach their full potential. Indeed, if you take a look at some of the </span><a href="https://openorgs.info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most valuable DAOs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out there, most of them are treasury DAOs for these Defi protocols.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, when it comes to community investing, DAOs are going to allow every single individual the ability to be part of a much more inclusive investment landscape. No longer will High Net Worth Individuals and VCs have exclusive rights to particular assets.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, would you have ever thought that a collection of disparate and anonymous investors would be </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2021/12/01/crypto-tokens-people-constitution-dao-ether-redeem-refund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a bidding competition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with one of the richest people in the world for a copy of the US constitution? Or that another group of anons could band together </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/dao-aims-to-raise-5m-to-resurrect-blockbuster-video"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a bid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to buy the Blockbuster brand? These are only two of a handful of examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then of course you have these DAOs beginning to play an active role in investments in digital assets like NFTs. As I mentioned in my newsletter two weeks ago, fractionalising and tokenising NFTs could be viewed as a security. However, if you own tokens in a completely decentralised organisation that invests in these assets, that could be something different. There are many of these DAOs that have been buying rare NFTs like </span><a href="https://pleasr.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PleasrDAO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.fwb.help/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FWB</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or how about all these Gaming Guild DAOs like YGG which I talked about a few days ago in </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1430"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this post.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The perfect confluence of NFTs, GameFi &amp; DAOs which I think could emerge as another important trend in 2022.¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAOs could also become the driving force behind the wide scale adoption and development of crypto &amp; Web 3.0 technology. You need look no further than the likes of </span><a href="https://bitdao.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BitDAO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which has a gargantuan $2.5 billion treasury. One that is helping to ‚Äúbuild the future of finance‚Äù. A DAO that is </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/universities-including-berkeley-mit-harvard-oxford-to-form-edudao-to-promote-web-3-innovations-financed-by-bitdao-treasury"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding R&amp;D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in some of the world‚Äôs top Universities. A DAO that you can be a part of by merely being a token holder.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are of course many other examples and use cases for these DAOs and I do hope to dive into them more this year. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs hyperbolic to say that they could make the world a better and more representative place.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span></p>

		<Title>Is This The Bear Market? Or is it Temporary?</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was no doubt a rough start to the year. This has left many wondering whether we are likely heading into that inevitable bear market.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don‚Äôt happen to think so, and I will be telling you exactly why in my market update.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before that, I want to bring your attention to one of the most insightful research reports that I have read of late.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a report by the folks over at Arcane Research. They are the research arm of a listed crypto company based out in Norway and I have been a long time fan of these reports. That is because they are comprehensive, insightful, data rich and often developed with a slant towards institutional investors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their 2021 summary report is one of their longest yet and it takes a look at some of the most important trends, topics and events of last year. They also have a number of predictions about what we could see this year for Bitcoin and the entire altcoin complex.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my video today, I break down the report page by page. I explain some of the key data and analyse exactly what it means for the markets. I also give my view of some of their predictions for the year and tie that in with some of those I have been making over the past 2 weeks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/FmhgHzvBEEU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here.</span></a></p>
<p><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decided to pick up a bit more ETH, SOL &amp; DOT. This was done with the remaining UST as well as the PAXG in my portfolio. I have chosen these three cryptos to buy mainly because I think they are the most undervalued given ecosystem development.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also moved over some USDC that I had placed in a lending pool and will be keeping it as dry powder in my portfolio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updated portfolio is:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 28.42% | BTC 20.81% | SOL 12.89% | DOT 11.16% | ATOM 6.67% | FTM 4.55% | HNT 3.11% | MATIC 2.37% | RUNE 2.02% | ADA 1.90% | INJ 1.25% | AR 1.24% | LINK 1.21% | USDC 1.07% | YGG 1.04% | XDEFI 0.29%</span></p>
<p><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 93.33% | Meebit 6.66%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre here for hopium, I‚Äôm happy to say that I have no shortage of it. Last week‚Äôs crash was brutal, but I am confident that it‚Äôs not the end of the bull market. This is for three simple reasons:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC balance on exchanges are still dropping (people not selling)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC dominance still dropping (money moving into alts)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC exchange leverage continues to hit </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-leverage-ratio-reaches-new-highs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">record highs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (traders are bullish).&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This third factor is more important than you think, because it makes almost all short term technical analysis null and void. BTC and ETH saw lots of liquidations last week, </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/07/ether-sees-higher-liquidations-than-bitcoin-after-falling-under-32k/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially ETH</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (hence why I loaded up on ETH). The downside volatility created by leveraged longs has a tendency to violate short term price patterns, or make bearish ones appear to have confirmed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why I chose to zoom out last week and take a look at what BTC was doing on the weekly. The Bollinger Band and RSI indicators suggest that we‚Äôre in the perfect </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Prkv45GfGUg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dip buying zone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean our troubles are over just yet. We could see another red candle for the crypto market next week, so bear that in mind before you go all in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And who‚Äôs to blame for this crash you might ask? Well, that would be the Federal Reserve, who hinted in their </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/world-markets-hawkish-fed-minutes-weigh-on-riskier-assets-.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">December meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they might start selling some of the trillions of dollars of government bonds they‚Äôve bought over the last few years. If they do this, it will raise interest rates beyond what they initially promised. This is why asset markets around the world tanked.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And why is the Federal Reserve wanting to raise interest rates? Well, that would be inflation which has been running hot for months. Here‚Äôs the kicker though. The Bureau of Labour Statistics </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/notices/2021/2022-weight-update.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced in December</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year that they will be changing the way the CPI is being measured in January this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, riddle me this: What happens if the new CPI figures coming out </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/cpi.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">next Wednesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mysteriously show a sharp decline in inflation? Chances are, asset markets will start to recover as they start to speculate on the possibility that the Federal Reserve will reconsider exactly how quickly they want to continue with the taper. You can bet that Fed officials will discuss this at their end of January meeting.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will be confirmed in mid February when the minutes (summary) of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs January meeting are </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220105a.htm#:~:text=The%20minutes%20for%20each%20regularly,in%20the%20Board's%20Annual%20Report."><span style="font-weight: 400;">made available</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I bet that their rhetoric around tapering will be more relaxed, and when you combine that with the fudged CPI numbers for January that come out a few days before the meeting minutes, markets will have all the hopium they need to rally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to get a sense of just how broken the CPI is, be sure to check out my video about that by </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJTUVPaNJ04"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clicking here.&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<p><b>üîö</b> <b>When in Doubt, Zoom Out (A lot)</b> <b>üîö</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many of you will know, altcoins are </span><a href="https://cryptowat.ch/correlations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly correlated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Bitcoin. If Bitcoin pumps, chances are altcoins will pump, and vice versa. As such, you can think of the price action of most altcoins (especially the larger ones) as being an imperfect reflection of BTC‚Äôs price action.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This got me thinking, what is BTC‚Äôs price action an imperfect reflection of? Put simply, what exactly influences the price of BTC?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a topic I covered in </span><a href="https://youtu.be/8a0LGCMrjAA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a video last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and if you watched that video you might remember that BTC and other cryptocurrencies exist in the deep end of the pool that is the financial market. When uncertainty is high, be it because of some pandemic or global conflict, investors tend to flock to safer assets. Conversely, when things are looking certain, investors crave risk (crypto).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, it‚Äôs safe to say that BTC‚Äôs price action is an imperfect reflection of the price action in the stock market. A correlation between the two has been known for quite some time, and has been </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/bitcoin-s-correlation-with-stocks-grows-as-risk-appetite-drops"><span style="font-weight: 400;">getting stronger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as of late. When it comes to zooming out, this is about as far as most crypto analysts get, including YouTubers such as myself.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that‚Äôs not zooming out enough. What exactly influences the prices of assets in the stock market?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you answered the Federal Reserve, you would be correct. As pointed out by one of my </span><a href="https://youtu.be/LoWOO3GtUBY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite crypto YouTubers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the price action of the S&amp;P 500 over the last 10 years </span><a href="https://twitter.com/heresyfinancial/status/1453434269481652225?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appears to be</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy. When they lower interest rates and spend, markets rise. When they raise interest rates and stop spending or sell, markets crash.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we‚Äôre still not zoomed out enough. What is it exactly about the Federal Reserve‚Äôs activities that causes the markets to rise and fall?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short answer is that it‚Äôs the effects its policies have on the US dollar, specifically its supply. Right now, most of the money in circulation is technically debt, which is why banks consider US dollars to be liabilities. Contrary to popular belief, most of the money isn‚Äôt created by the Federal Reserve per se. It‚Äôs created by the banks who </span><a href="https://youtu.be/jaOb_LgQ2jA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lend that money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into being.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This money is of course lent out to individuals and institutions. What these individuals and institutions are ultimately doing is borrowing from their future earnings, because eventually that debt needs to be repaid. When that debt is paid back, money is technically destroyed - removed from circulation. This causes the </span><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/us-dollar-index-struggles-for-direction-around-9620-ahead-of-nfp-202201070856"><span style="font-weight: 400;">price of the US dollar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relative to other assets to rise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And because investors are always ‚Äú</span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forward-looking.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forward looking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äù, when the Federal Reserve says it‚Äôs going to increase interest rates in the future, investors react today by paying off some debt in anticipation, which requires selling assets if they‚Äôve taken on too much leverage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, you could say that crypto prices are an imperfect (inverse) reflection of what‚Äôs going on with the US dollar. I could zoom out further to tell you what else influences the price of the US dollar, but I think it‚Äôs best you listen </span><a href="https://youtu.be/TWSIkBNegjA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the experts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it comes to that one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üïπ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><b>Why GameFi </b><b>üïπ</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few weeks I have stated that I was quite bullish on GameFi especially in 2022. However, I haven't fully explained why.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite simply, it's because of the sheer size of the current traditional gaming ecosystem and how fast it is growing. Here are some stats from </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/5-reasons-why-blockchain-based-gaming-economies-are-the-future"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in CoinTelegraph last year:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gaming market is worth $180 billion. This is greater than $100 billion for film and $73 billion for sports</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three of the top four most-viewed sporting events in 2018 were E-sports events</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some predict we will see the number of streamers rise to 1 billion in 2025</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gamers </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/829395/consumer-spending-loot-boxes-skins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent 15 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on in-game "loot" last year</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ok, but why would these gamers benefit from blockchain gaming you ask?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, because these entire gaming ecosystems exist in walled gardens. The developers own the assets and can do whatever they want with it. In fact, this reality is one of the prime reasons that Vitalik Buterin became so interested in decentralised technology. According to </span><a href="https://about.me/vitalik_buterin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this post:</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With NFTs and a decentralised blockchain, you own those assets. You can move them wherever you want and sell them freely. Not only can they be converted into cryptocurrency but also fiat. This therefore means that you have an ecosystem and economy where people can realise real world tangible results from their gaming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where the "Play to Earn" factor comes in. People playing online games in order to generate wealth and income for themselves. The sector is massive and games like Axie Infinity have demonstrated just how much demand there is for these non-traditional sources of income.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's not just hopium. Here are some stats from last year:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Q3 of last year, we saw </span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/12/16/blockchain-game-association-nft-games-generated-2-32b-in-q3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.32 billion in sales of NFT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> assets which was 20% of all sales</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of early December, GameFi‚Äôs weekly active users have </span><a href="https://medium.com/huobi-research/how-new-institutional-economics-explains-the-rise-of-gamefi-e9893ba6a7c7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reached 9.21 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a record high.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five of the top 9 dApps in dApp rankings are GameFi related</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market cap of virtual </span><a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/blockchain-behavior-report-interest-in-the-metaverse-and-play-to-earn-booming-in-asia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">world reached $4.6 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and some land sales topped $42 million</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it's quite clear that the trend is moving in that direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I often hear from gamers, however, is that blockchain games are far removed from being really "playable". I tend to agree. You are not going to get the hardcore gamers to drop what they are playing to battle with Axies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are a number of titles that are launching this year that are looking to transform that. Games that are built from the ground up to be playable first. One of these is </span><a href="https://twitter.com/playbigtime/status/1478791267047907330?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BigTime gaming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that recently completed a public sale of their in-game SPACE NFT tokens. I bought a bunch of these and will be adding to my portfolio once they are released in the game.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said all of this though, I am also aware that some gamers are incredibly averse and sceptical of NFTs. Sometimes, they are openly </span><a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/square-enix-president-nfts-games"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hostile towards them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In some cases, this can be justified especially when the NFTs are just used as a money grab. However, as we have seen in the traditional finance space more broadly, crypto was ridiculed and attacked for years before the banks started getting on board. I happen to think that the hardcore gamers could eventually come into the fold.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond this though, it's also worth seeing where the smart money is positioning their investments. It seems that a great deal of them are diving into </span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/06/sky-mavis-raises-152m-at-nearly-3b-valuation-for-axie-infinity-play-to-earn-nft-game/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play-to-Earn games</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/21/crypto-vcs-are-making-a-big-bet-on-gaming-guilds-why/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guilds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and blockchain gaming titles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they say: Follow the money!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will be doing a video on some of the most exciting projects in the GameFi space in the coming few weeks - so keep an eye out for that.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîí </span><b>Upgrade Your Crypto Security:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yes, the markets are pretty bloody right now. However, now might be a good time to take your mind off the stress of the markets and instead focus on something you can control: Your Crypto Security!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people just leave their crypto on an exchange or use a free self custodial wallet. However, the crypto savvy try to stack the deck in their favour by upgrading that security to a hardware wallet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But which one do you choose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, I use </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/trezor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as my hardware wallet of choice. I have done a video about the various types of hardware wallet on the market and you can watch that </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t3Brlb0qzQ&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here!</span></a></p>

		<Title>Web 3 Revolution!! Don‚Äôt Miss This!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most heated debates of the past few weeks has been on Web 3. Some have claimed that it is merely the purview of Venture Capitalists and whales. That the tech is still quite centralised, slow and unable to reach mass adoption.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well today, I am going to show you exactly why Web 3 is our best hope to break free from the centralised status quo. A reality where our data is harvested for profit by companies that will willingly pull our access at a moment‚Äôs notice.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there are valid concerns that need to be addressed about Web 3. Not only the standard ones but also others that have been raised. I will be talking about all of these in the video and what they could mean for the future of Web 3.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that video </span><a href="https://youtu.be/bpaKQ3CZpVs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></p>
<p><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes to the portfolio this week folks. Pretty happy with the allocation and am waiting to see how things play out in the traditional markets over the coming weeks (see below IMF report).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allocation is:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 27.82% | BTC 19.60% | SOL 12.65% | DOT 11.55% | ATOM 7.48% | FTM 5.95% | HNT 2.94% | MATIC 2.49% | ADA 2.09% | RUNE 1.93% | INJ 1.20% | AR 1.13% | LINK 1.06% | USDC 0.97% | YGG 0.92% | XDEFI 0.23%</span></p>
<p><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 93.75% | Meebit 6.25%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs been a tense week in the crypto market but it looks like it could have been a lot worse. This is because investors across the board were bracing for brutal inflation figures in the United States on Wednesday and while the figures were brutal, 7% was exactly what investors were expecting. Whether or not this has to do with the </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/notices/2021/2022-weight-update.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">January adjustment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the CPI remains to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not surprisingly, the crypto market rallied in response to the news and it‚Äôs a rally that had begun the day before. This might have something to do with all the bullish news that came out last week, the most significant of which is probably the rapid recovery of Bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate after miners in Kazakhstan </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/10/major-mining-pools-bitcoin-hashrate-nears-recovery-as-kazakhstans-internet-is-partially-restored/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">came back online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another bullish sign is the balance of BTC on exchanges that continues to drop. As I‚Äôve mentioned many times before, when BTC moves off exchanges then it means people are HODLing and not selling. Conversely, when BTC is moving on to exchanges then it means people are selling and not HODLing. More about on-chain analysis </span><a href="https://youtu.be/pk1MyzlhBJk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all this said, there is one thing going on in the crypto market that has me concerned, and that‚Äôs the death cross that BTC just painted on the daily chart. If you watched my first </span><a href="https://youtu.be/lW3eWIj3Q04"><span style="font-weight: 400;">technical analysis tutorial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you‚Äôll know a death cross is a sign of bad times to come. It also doesn‚Äôt help that we‚Äôve definitively fallen below both the 128 and 200 day moving averages either.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only reason why I‚Äôm not super concerned about these technical indicators is because of what I‚Äôm seeing on the monthly chart. Assuming we close this month at a loss, that will mark three months of red. This is the same decline we saw during the crash last spring, and if history repeats, February, March, and April will be green. </span><a href="https://youtu.be/e0cd5ET_k0Q"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These milestones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could make it happen.¬†</span></p>
<p><b>üîö</b> <b>Growth vs. Value in Crypto </b><b>üîö</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, I love watching interviews with the founders of crypto projects as part of my research. Avalanche founder Emin Gun Sirer has been doing weekly AMAs (of sorts) on the official </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCScsLTtz5DCwJodZ8ht9KNA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avalanche YouTube channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and in one of these he discussed the notion of growth vs. value in investing, specifically in terms of cryptocurrency.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who don‚Äôt know, growth and value are two terms used to describe two broad categories of stocks. </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthstock.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growth stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> belong to companies that are expected to grow significantly in the future (e.g. Tesla). By contrast, </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuestock.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">value stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> belong to companies that are generating revenue today, and also giving dividends to shareholders (depending on your definition).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether investors are buying growth or value stocks depends </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/072415/value-or-growth-stocks-which-best.asp#:~:text=Growth%20stocks%20are%20those%20companies,thus%20provide%20a%20superior%20return."><span style="font-weight: 400;">heavily on interest rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a low interest rate environment, investors tend to favour growth stocks primarily because of the easy access their respective companies have to credit, regardless of revenue. When interest rates are high however, investors favour value stocks because credit is expensive and revenue is king.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you apply this taxonomy to cryptocurrency, it‚Äôs pretty clear which coins and tokens fall into which category. At the extreme end of growth you have cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin whose potential is based on future promises. At the extreme end of value you have smart contract cryptocurrencies like Ethereum which generate revenue due their coins‚Äô utility as </span><a href="https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/if-ether-is-digital-oil-bitcoin-is-digital-gold-2513778"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should come as no surprise then that smart contract cryptocurrencies have been rallying like crazy while the rest of the crypto market struggles. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs recent rhetoric around interest rates has spooked investors out of growth and into value both in cryptocurrency and the stock market. It will be interesting to see how long this rotation lasts given </span><a href="https://www.troweprice.com/financial-intermediary/us/en/insights/articles/2021/q1/rotation-from-growth-to-value.html#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20value%20performance%20cycles,is%20the%20longest%20on%20record."><span style="font-weight: 400;">historical trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üïπ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span><b>The IMF Said What?! </b><b>üïπ</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most bullish indicators for me as to the potential of Bitcoin &amp; cryptocurrency is when powerful opponents feel threatened. And, when it comes to powerful financial opponents, perhaps one of the largest has got to be the International Monetary Fund or IMF.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs because the IMF can be seen as the banker for countries. An international high yield lender that has been profiting off the global fiat system ever since the end of World War 2.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, any sort of challenge from a decentralised technology like cryptocurrency is likely to upset them.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in July of last year, the IMF released </span><a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2021/07/26/cryptoassets-as-national-currency-a-step-too-far/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that came out and attacked the idea of using cryptocurrency as a legal tender. This report came about a month after El Salvador announced that they would be the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report basically claimed that having cryptocurrency as a legal tender ‚Äúcould harm macro-financial stability, financial integrity, consumer protection and the environment‚Äù. Of course, no hit piece on Bitcoin is complete without mentioning how it can be used to ‚Äúlaunder ill-gotten money, fund terrorism, and evade taxes‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in October last year, they came out with their </span><a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2021/10/12/global-financial-stability-report-october-2021"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Financial Stability report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unsurprisingly, some of the challenges that they foresaw were ‚ÄúCovid 19, Climate &amp; Crypto‚Äù. You can see in the </span><a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Images/IMF/Publications/GFSR/2021/October/gfsr-ocotber-2021-key-highlights-infographic.ashx#.YeGWMEZnyDA.link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">key highlights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over here that the size of Crypto‚Äôs Market Cap is in the ‚ÄúRisks‚Äù category. That is perhaps one of the most disingenuous comparisons that I have seen but sadly expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They used all of these as a reason as to why countries should consider a universal response to cryptocurrency regulation. In a </span><a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2021/12/09/global-crypto-regulation-should-be-comprehensive-consistent-and-coordinated/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of December last year, they claimed that the existence of all these cryptocurrency ‚Äúrisks‚Äù underscore why there is a need for international standards that are co-ordinated.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They even suggested a number of rules which could be implemented and, quite predictably, they suggested that the IMF‚Äôs Financial Stability Board should ‚Äúdevelop a global framework comprising standards for regulation of crypto assets‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, just about a week ago they </span><a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/global-financial-stability-notes/Issues/2022/01/10/Cryptic-Connections-511776"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released a report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that examined the historical correlation (i.e., relationship) between crypto assets and the stock markets. The analysis further confirmed the fact that crypto markets</span><a href="https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Bitcoin-Blog-chart.jpg"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have become</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> much more correlated with the equity markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, this relationship has been known for some time and it is something </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcnZYRhjQq4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have covered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the channel ad nauseum. Investors place crypto in their ‚Äúrisk on‚Äù bucket which means that it is likely to react to many of the same global macro factors as Equity.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the IMF also did some analysis that claimed that this ‚Äúcrypto-equity‚Äù spillover is a risk to global financial markets. They said, ‚ÄúIncreased crypto-stocks correlation raises the possibility of spillovers of investor sentiment between those asset classes. ... A sharp decline in bitcoin prices can increase investor risk aversion and lead to a fall in investment in stock markets.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, that‚Äôs a stretch even for the IMF. But, what it shows is that they increasingly see a risk of cryptocurrency to the financial system that they help to control. If it‚Äôs not a country‚Äôs fiscus, it‚Äôs the climate. If it‚Äôs not consumer protection, it‚Äôs financial contagion.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I have made clear in my video today about Web 3, centralised powers benefit most when there is no challenge to the status quo. If that is challenged, they have to fight back.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span></p>
<p><b>üåé Blockchain Domains:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There has been a lot of attention on NFTs recently. But most of the NFTs with insane value right now have very little use cases. There is a lot of hype but not that much utility.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is one category of NFTs that don‚Äôt only have a rarity component but also a strong utility and use case. Those are blockchain domains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These can be used for accepting payments, personalising addresses and eventually they could power the decentralised web with a distributed domain name system.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, because of their unique qualities, these domains have become the new realm of online real estate for domain investors. If you will think back to the 1990s and early 2000‚Äôs, hot .com domains were all the rage and investors who got in early were </span><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/the-top-20-most-expensive-domain-names/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">handsomely rewarded.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were wondering where you can get your hands on those blockchain domains and are looking for a domain with potential, then you can hop over to </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/unstoppable-domains/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unstoppable Domains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they have the largest selection of crypto domain extensions.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Unstoppable Domains has just launched on Polygon which means that you can mint those domains at a fraction of the cost with 0 gas fees! They have also released their Ethereum &amp; Polygon sign in service which allows for a seamless web 3 connection - decentralised and permissionless!</span></p>

		<Title>Do You Hold ETH? Know THIS!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There were many projections for ETH...</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year saw people throw around 10k, 20k or more. However, ever since 2022 came around, many of those lofty projections appear to have fallen by the wayside and in a big way. Now, many are just wondering whether it can once again reclaim its all-time high.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that depends on a number of factors. Factors that are central to Ethereum's progress this year and beyond.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And this is exactly what I will be exploring in my video today. I will be doing a much-needed 2022 update of Ethereum and its potential. I will also be looking at this through the lens of ETH 2.0 and that all important proof of stake merge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that this could be closer than many of us think and the implications of it for the entire ecosystem cannot be overstated. I will also be examining one central reason why ETH could become the darling of institutions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there are also going to be some challenges that could derail that. Challenges that I clearly elucidate in the video.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you hold ETH (or are considering picking it up), then you can't afford to </span><a href="https://youtu.be/GTUpnBpD4Bk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">miss this video!</span></a>

<b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of ETH, I bought some more of it as well as some BTC. This was done with some USDC that I have moved over from my lending accounts. The remaining USDC was converted to UST in order to be kept as dry powder for other altcoins.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to buy this dip mainly because the current market is irrational and being driven by factors unrelated to cryptocurrency (see below). It‚Äôs in these times that you have to make a judgement call on fundamental value.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason that I am holding dry powder in UST is because of it being decentralised. On top of that, it has been able to hold that $1 peg exceptionally well over the recent dip. I have an updated video coming on Terra so you will want to keep an eye out for that.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My portfolio currently sits at:¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 28.28% | BTC 22.63% | SOL 11.15% | DOT 10.13% | ATOM 7.46% | FTM 5.39% | HNT 2.67% | MATIC 2.29% | ADA 2.19% | RUNE 1.64% | USDC 1.33% | AR 1.03% | INJ 1.01% | UST 0.99% | LINK 0.87% | YGG 0.72% | XDEFI 0.24%</span>

<b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 94.40% | Meebit 5.60%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you hear that? That is the sound of millions of paper hands capitulating as whales buy up their BTC and ETH. Don‚Äôt believe me? Check on-chain. The BTC balance on exchanges</span><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=distribution.BalanceExchangesRelative"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is dropping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in tandem with the price as people HODL. Even the Bitcoin miners are </span><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=distribution.BalanceMinersChange&amp;s=1569116003&amp;u=1642809600&amp;zoom="><span style="font-weight: 400;">accumulating BTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That can only mean one thing: it‚Äôs not over, at least not yet.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With that out of the way, what the hell is going on?¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôll start by saying that this crash isn‚Äôt being caused by something crypto specific. Asset markets are crashing across the board, and because crypto is still (unfortunately) </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/bitcoin-s-correlation-with-stocks-grows-as-risk-appetite-drops"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quite correlated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the stock market, anything that happens there will eventually affect the crypto market. Following a bloody Friday, many market analysts are saying the stock market crash will </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-expert-warns-sp500-drop-bubble-taper-hussman-2022-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only accelerate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, the question is why?¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides fears over the Federal Reserve </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-raise-rates-three-times-this-year-tame-unruly-inflation-2022-01-20/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing interest rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the answer seems to be China. Property developers in the country have started to implode, and this has driven the Chinese central bank to </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/china-set-cut-interest-rates-standing-lending-facility-loans-sources-2022-01-21/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower interest rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an attempt to prop domestic markets back up. This is a pretty big deal because China had previously stated that they would do nothing of the sort.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúBut what does it mean?‚Äù you might ask.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I suppose it depends on who you ask. </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/21/investing/jeremy-grantham-stock-bubble/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some are saying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that this is only the beginning of the ‚Äúeverything bubble‚Äù or ‚Äúsuperbubble‚Äù bursting, meaning there are many more down days (and possibly weeks) ahead. With the weakness we‚Äôre seeing in the economy, be it due to supply chain issues or </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3786483-1-in-4-workers-are-planning-on-quitting-their-jobs-in-2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">people opting out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the workforce, it‚Äôs very possible that this is what‚Äôs coming.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other extreme, you have the likes of Ark Invest‚Äôs Cathie Wood </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/arks-wood-turns-focus-deflation-stay-connected-stocks-2022-01-11/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doubling down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and insisting that the pain we‚Äôre seeing is only temporary. This is primarily because the supply chain issues that are holding the economy back are being caused by the pandemic (or more accurately, pandemic restrictions), and it looks like some countries are </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/12/should-we-treat-covid-like-the-flu-europe-is-starting-to-think-so.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">starting to ease off</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And then you have folks like me who are more in the middle of the road. While I do think that we‚Äôre in for a bit more pain in both the crypto market and the stock market, </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-price-falls-to-34k-as-bitcoin-rsi-reaches-most-oversold-since-march-2020-crash"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the weekly chart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for BTC suggests that it may be high time </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1484897999062982663?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to accumulate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The fundamentals are also strong, with companies planning to pile </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/andreessen-horowitz-aims-to-raise-4-5-billion-to-invest-in-crypto-funds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">billions of dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into crypto projects this year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In my mind, the only thing to worry about with crypto is central bank digital currencies, and it looks like the Federal Reserve is the latest central bank to officially throw their hat in the ring.¬†</span>

<b>üîö</b> <b>Fed CBDC overview </b><b>üîö</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Thursday, the Federal Reserve finally</span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed the whitepaper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for its digital dollar. As far as I can tell, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell first announced that the Fed would be releasing a digital dollar whitepaper in </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/fed-will-issue-discussion-paper-on-benefits-and-risks-of-cbdc-says-jerome-powell"><span style="font-weight: 400;">May last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means it‚Äôs been in the works for quite some time, and I find it interesting that Jerome dragged his feet on publishing it‚Ä¶ I digress.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing about </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-20220120.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that caught my eye was one of the 6 preconditions the Federal Reserve notes for the issuance of a CBDC, specifically the second one which states ‚Äú[a digital dollar] must yield [benefits to consumers] more effectively than alternative methods‚Äù. In my mind, this is a not so subtle reference to stablecoins, which could end up becoming ‚Äú</span><a href="https://youtu.be/JZRDwS6ACHc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">synthetic CBDCs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äù.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing that stuck out to me was the focus around privacy, something that was picked up by various </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/20/federal-reserve-highlights-privacy-financial-stability-concerns-in-cbdc-white-paper/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto news outlets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well. As you can imagine, a digital currency controlled by the government is at odds with privacy, and there are some very justified concerns to be had about that, as well as a CBDC‚Äôs impacts on </span><a href="https://youtu.be/7Lu0uhrueWI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial stability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which the Fed also acknowledges.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, my research so far suggests that there has been </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-central-banker-urges-digital-dollar-development"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extreme pressure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Federal Reserve to develop a digital dollar. This is primarily because almost every other central bank is </span><a href="https://cbdctracker.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rushing to develop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their own CBDC, namely China. Having a CBDC basically means that these countries will no longer be dependent on the US dollar, which is bad news for the United States.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, digital dollar proponents argue that it‚Äôs imperative for the Federal Reserve to release a digital dollar so that the USD remains the world‚Äôs reserve currency. Not surprisingly, s</span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/fed-s-lael-brainard-invites-congress-to-choose-whether-to-compete-with-china-s-digital-yuan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ome of these</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proponents are on the Federal Reserve board of governors, but what‚Äôs interesting is that </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-bowman-cbdc-idUSKBN2HT2K4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not everyone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Federal Reserve is on board with the idea of a digital dollar.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While the adjustment of the Federal Reserve board‚Äôs composition is probably not going to influence what they do about </span><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/brainard-pledges-fed-combat-inflation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interest rates and inflation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it‚Äôs very likely that it will influence what they do about the digital dollar. Consider for a moment that 3 of those 7 seats have yet to be filled, though the nominees were </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/01/13/biden-fed-nominees-raskin-cook-jefferson/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by US President Joe Biden.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre wondering what this means for the prospect of a digital dollar, you‚Äôll have to stay tuned for my video later this week to find out!¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî≠</span> <b>Some Perspective </b><b>üî≠</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no doubt that the past week has been a really rough one in the crypto markets. For some of you, this may be your first time experiencing a severe market rout. I know this because in December last year, I </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1472192915464196096"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushed this poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that asked you guys how long you had been in crypto.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see from the results, over 50% of you folks got into crypto last year. A year when crypto markets rallied to all time highs on the back of unprecedented and sustained Fed stimulus. If that was all you knew, then it‚Äôs completely understandable that you may be worried about the current dip.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am here to tell you: Don‚Äôt be!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As some of you may know, we launched the Coin Bureau back in 2017. This was also a time when crypto markets were going crazy and everyone was making a lot of money in high flying ICOs. By the end of the year I was incredibly chuffed with the performance in my portfolio. I thought that the good times would continue rolling in 2018.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that was not the case‚Ä¶¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As January came around, the markets suffered a sustained fall. All those hot ICOs went bust and ETH &amp; BTC were in a tailspin. I was incredibly worried not only because my wealth was dramatically reduced but also because I had gone full time into crypto. My future was inextricably tied to the crypto markets.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was at this time that I decided to talk to a friend of mine who had been in Bitcoin since 2013. He recanted all these stories about how crazy those early days were and how some of his compatriots had parted with thousands of BTC. Partly this was because they couldn‚Äôt handle the volatility and the other part was because they didn‚Äôt believe in the long term potential.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it was with that in mind that I decided to hodl on. Work continued as we built the Coin Bureau. The more research that we did for videos, the more confident I became about inevitable mass adoption and an eventual reversal. Whether that was going to happen in 2, 3 or 5 years, I knew it was an industry I wanted to be a part of. That resolve is what kept us working through the Bear market and it was that undying belief that allowed me to reap the gains of the hard work in 2020 &amp; 2021.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Am I saying we are in the same period now? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. I don‚Äôt think that this recent dip is the bear market. Crypto is no longer the market it once was and there is too much institutional interest for it to fall by the wayside for 2-3 years. Those that actively lobbied against crypto in 2017-2019 are now embracing it with open arms. Regulators that once dismissed crypto as a meme are scrambling to craft laws in order to contain it. Central Banks that once laughed off the notion of decentralised money are now developing their own CBDCs.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is, times have changed. But, there will always be market cycles. And with these market cycles come as new investors who have to deal with the inevitable periods of uncertainty.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you are relatively new to the markets and feeling uneasy, I hope that my experience and perspective helps you the way my friend‚Äôs did in 2017. It‚Äôs never nice to see your investment depreciate in value but it's only ever a loss if you sell at a loss. As long as you have not over extended yourself and you have invested prudently, short to medium term price action should not perturb you.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Diamonds are formed with centuries of extreme pressure. The longer and stronger the pressure, the larger and more beautiful the stones. That‚Äôs why I think the ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù analogy is a lot more than a meme.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep calm, and hodl on!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deals of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs been a bit of a hairy week. Be it in the crypto markets or the broader stock markets. Yes, many crypto fans are fearful, however, others might be feeling kind of greedy with the discounts on crypto available today.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if you want to take advantage of those sales? Well, you‚Äôll need a top-notch fiat to crypto onramp solution. Personally, I use the </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/swissborg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swissborg app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The app supports </span><b>over 30 cryptocurrencies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>16 fiat currencies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including some pretty exotic ones like the Polish Zloty and the South African Rand. So, that means that you are unlikely to be hit with those annoying foreign exchange fees.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The app supports crypto dabblers from almost every country outside of the US. Also, withdrawals on Swissborg can be lightning fast too - I‚Äôve had funds hit my bank account within minutes.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Swissborg also provides a super simple way to stake cryptocurrencies, with interest rates as high as 24%! So, if you are interested in earning crypto interest then you‚Äôll want to check that out too!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even better, if you </span><b>deposit ‚Ç¨50</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or more then you‚Äôll get up to </span><b>‚Ç¨100 FREE!</b>

		<Title>Is this a New Crypto Winter??</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs been a rough start to the year‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, with the Fed looking like it‚Äôs raising rates in March, there are concerns that we could be entering that Bear market.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, what‚Äôs even more concerning than this is the prospect that this crypto bear market could translate into a longer crypto winter. One that sees subdued prices and lackluster interest for a year or more.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, are we headed to a cold crypto winter?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, one of the best ways to judge this is to compare and contrast the market conditions now to those that preceded the previous crypto winter. That was back in 2018 &amp; 2019. Two long and hard years in the crypto space. One that many of us had experienced first hand.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In my video today, I am going to be taking a look at the two different periods and analysing if there are any similarities or differences. I will also take a look at what is driving the market now and give my perspective of whether the market rout that we have seen will continue.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch my latest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span>

<b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes to the portfolio since last week. Pretty happy with my allocation at the moment. Although, I am looking at potentially picking up some more FTM if levels justify it.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am also considering picking up a small allocation of LUNA but think we may have more attractive entry points in the coming days. I will be covering Terra in much more detail in a video I have coming - so keep your eyes peeled.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, I will keep you updated with moves in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. My updated portfolio is:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 29.19% | BTC 23.35% | SOL 10.46% | DOT 10.14% | ATOM 6.38% | FTM 5.06% | HNT 3.14% | MATIC 2.32% | ADA 2.06% | RUNE 1.66% | USDC 1.27% | AR 1.09% | INJ 0.96% | UST 0.95% | LINK 0.94% | YGG 0.79% | XDEFI 0.26%</span>

<b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 95.23% | Meebit 4.76%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week I mentioned that this week would determine which way the crypto market is headed in the short to medium term. This was primarily because of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs press conference on Wednesday, and the worries of what they would say about raising interest rates. Luckily, it looks like they‚Äôre sticking to </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/fomc-meeting-federal-reserve/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the original schedule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so the crypto and stock markets didn‚Äôt crash.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the markets didn‚Äôt exactly rally either, at least not until Apple released its record high </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/27/apple-aapl-earnings-q1-2022.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quarterly earnings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Friday. Apple is the largest company by market cap, and it‚Äôs believed that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are correlated to tech stocks such as Apple. As such, it looks like Apple carried the crypto market and the stock market into the green.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn‚Äôt a stretch to say either, because Apple also announced their own </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/apple-stock-jumps-after-ceo-reveals-it-s-investing-in-the-metaverse"><span style="font-weight: 400;">metaverse plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Recall that Apple CEO Tim Cook holds crypto too. Speaking of which, Tim also said that Apple is seeing supply chain issues ease as countries drop pandemic restrictions. This is seriously good news, because most of the inflationary pressures seem to be coming from supply chain disruptions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So consider this‚Ä¶¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates to fight inflation being caused primarily by supply chain issues (or </span><a href="https://youtu.be/K0mzZg1FAhs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">so they say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), then what happens if, say, the World Health Organisation suddenly declares the pandemic is now more of an endemic?¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This would mean that countries would no longer have a leg to stand on when it comes to these restrictions. The more countries that lift these restrictions, the less bottlenecks in the supply chain. While it may take some time for it to clear the current backlog, the positive sentiment around this announcement could help to lift the markets.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of many ‚Äúwhite swans‚Äù on the horizon that could lead to a nice recovery across the board. By the same token though, there are some black swans that appeared last week as well. The most significant of these is probably the upcoming </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/white-house-reportedly-preparing-executive-order-on-crypto"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order on cryptocurrency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that‚Äôs expected to be signed as soon as next week (covered below)¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also ongoing concerns about energy shortages around the world, including </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/28/investing/natural-gas-prices/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the United States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This has resulted in many countries cutting off crypto mining operations to preserve power, and it‚Äôs possible that this could happen in some US states. An upcoming video I‚Äôm doing will analyze what US politicians have been saying about crypto mining, so stay tuned.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For what it‚Äôs worth, the charts and fundamentals are looking damn good. BTC balances on exchanges </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/28/bitcoin-worth-670m-leave-centralized-exchanges-after-hawkish-fed-comments/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to fall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and we seem to be seeing some actual momentum to the upside for the first time in weeks. There‚Äôs of course no guarantee that this will continue, but it‚Äôs the best sign we‚Äôve seen in a while.¬†</span>

<b>üÉè</b> <b>DeFi Drama</b> <b>üÉè</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of all the innovations in cryptocurrency, decentralised finance is arguably one of the most important. The ability to trade, borrow, lend, and save without a middleman is the pinnacle of financial freedom. The proof is in the pudding - the protocols that power this technology have </span><a href="https://defillama.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hundreds of billions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of dollars in total value locked. If only they were truly decentralized.¬†¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulators such as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that most DeFi protocols are centralised enough to face the scrutiny of regulators. There is no denying that there is truth to this statement, and it‚Äôs one that unfortunately applies to many crypto projects as well. The intense competition in the crypto space has made centralisation tempting, after all.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulations aside, the fact of the matter is that centralisation increases risk because humans are corruptible. This was put on full display during a recent fiasco involving a DeFi protocol on Avalanche called Wonderland. In short, Wonderland is a fork of </span><a href="https://youtu.be/l0vRTi8_FRk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olympus DAO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a DeFi protocol on Ethereum that‚Äôs essentially aiming to be the central bank of cryptocurrency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Olympus DAO, Wonderland was infamous for providing insanely high yields to users who deposited funds into the protocol (one of the many red flags of a scam). Wonderland was also famous because of its prolific founder, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/SadlkVqF2zA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniele Sestagalli</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who is a well known DeFi developer that‚Äôs worked closely with the likes of Andre Cronje (Yearn Finance founder).¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wonderland wasn‚Äôt a one man show though. There was another DeFi personality who went by the pseudonym 0xSifu. Nobody knew who he was (another red flag), until another DeFi sleuth named </span><a href="https://rekt.news/sifu-scandal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZachXBT revealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 0xSifu was the co-founder of Quadriga CX, a cryptocurrency exchange that shut down in 2019 after its founder disappeared with the crypto.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, Michael Patryn (0xSifu) has a </span><a href="https://financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/a-criminal-past-haunts-surviving-founder-of-troubled-cryptocurrency-exchange-quadriga"><span style="font-weight: 400;">history of financial crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which left the crypto community wondering why Daniele chose to partner with this individual. The answer seems to be money. Michael was an early investor in another DeFi project Daniele had founded. Daniele also claims to this day that Michael is not the same person he was before.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wonderland community didn‚Äôt buy it though, and </span><a href="https://snapshot.org/#/bestfork.eth/proposal/0x8f974b76d4f50ea26a1f44843dcda2e0f6a4736883968b29996d272b86b447a9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to remove Michael from the project not long after the news broke. There is </span><a href="https://snapshot.org/#/bestfork.eth/proposal/0xf24f389b80f1e056c8f308802767d77060cbeecf17afd8d379ea71b3ded6ebb5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also a vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is currently running to entirely close down Wonderland and give the funds back to the community. Even so, this saga has no doubt attracted the attention of regulators around the world.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let this be a lesson to the crypto community and DeFi community. If we do not regulate ourselves, then the real regulators will come in, and it will not be pretty. Luckily there are a lot of actual crypto journalists out there who are keeping tabs on what‚Äôs going on, but the best medicine is prevention. What‚Äôs the solution? </span><a href="https://youtu.be/MFEXFvCFywc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better governance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Let‚Äôs hope it comes soon.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of regulations‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üá∫üá∏</span> <b>Regulators on The Attack </b><b>üá∫üá∏</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just when you thought some of those politicians in DC were done with their attempts at regulating crypto, they come from left of field with a raft of measures and proposals.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of these </span><a href="https://www.coincenter.org/new-bill-would-hand-treasury-blank-check-to-ban-crypto-at-exchanges/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was a provision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was snuck into a House bill (the COMPETES Act). The Act is legislation that is aimed at increasing economic competitiveness with China. However, it has now served as a trojan horse for this seemingly unrelated and toxic provision.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More specifically, the provision would give the treasury arbitrary powers to block all US financial institutions from interacting with a crypto exchange, jurisdiction that has crypto exchanges, crypto exchanges by a non-US miner or even transactions coming from non-US custodial wallets.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This provision aims to greatly expand existing laws that the treasury already has to impose restrictions on transactions like this. The only difference is that those laws have to come with consultation of the Fed and numerous other federal regulators before doing so. Moreover, there is a time limit on these restrictions and they could lift it in 120 days.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, quite simply, this provision will give Janet Yellen‚Äôs Treasury department arbitrary powers to impose on exchanges when it sees fit. Impositions that do not need to be discussed with anyone else and can last indefinitely.¬†¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It should also be noted that this provision has been inserted by the same member who tried to insert </span><a href="https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/D091421.082.xml210915100132965.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a similar provision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the National Defense Authorization Act last year. This was an essential bill that kept the US military funded which thankfully did not pass with the provision as it was struck just in time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1486405402472468491?s=20&amp;t=4bILzJzfmtVfBcXxHt_UAg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pretty alarming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to me when these politicians jam unrelated provisions into must-pass bills. Let‚Äôs also not forget that this happened last year with </span><a href="https://youtu.be/0aQ3SYHEQyo?t=942"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the infrastructure bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Indeed, if it wasn‚Äôt for the efforts of the </span><a href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain lobby</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many more of these laws would have made their way through congress. It also makes¬† me wonder how many laws are being passed on a regular basis without anyone in the voting public actually knowing about it until the enforcement hits them in the face.¬†¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, to add to the rumblings on Capitol hill, the White House also threw some FUD our way with news of a potential </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/white-house-is-set-to-put-itself-at-center-of-u-s-crypto-policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Biden on cryptocurrencies‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact details of the Executive Order are yet to be announced, but according to sources, it would be issued in a national security memorandum. It would assign some government entities to study crypto, stablecoins and NFTs with the goal of developing a workable regulatory framework.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that this EO will be placed in the context of ‚Äúnational security‚Äù goes to show that the fear stems from the cross-border payments for potential illicit activity. It‚Äôs therefore no surprise that this is coming at about the same time as the aforementioned provision which gives Treasury control of these cross border payments.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it‚Äôs a lot easier to convince people of the need for regulation and control when it is done on the grounds of ‚ÄúNational Security‚Äù. Fear sells and even though illicit activity plays </span><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/fact-check-crypto-is-increasingly-being-used-for-criminal-activity-and-is-a-haven-for-illicit-856a71dfb399"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a miniscule role</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in overall activity, it‚Äôs the narrative that is important.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That aside, the COMPETES Act has a long way to go and my hope is that the provision will be removed when it heads to the Senate. Indeed, a competing lawmaker has already introduced </span><a href="https://budd.house.gov/uploadedfiles/budd_--_competes_act_crypto_fix_amendment.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that simply eliminates the provision altogether. As it relates to Biden‚Äôs incoming EO, I will be keeping my eyes peeled and my ears to the ground.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, as I made clear in my video today, the mere fact that these regulations have made their way into the halls of congress and beyond is because crypto has become such a transformative force. We can only hope that there are more politicians that are on our side who are able to stand guard at the gates and defend the progress we have made.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üì±</span> <b>I‚Äôm Going Live </b><b>üì±</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In case some of you didn‚Äôt know, I have been holding weekly livestreams </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@coinbureau"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on my TikTok</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every Friday.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those hodling with diamond hands have been in for a bit of a bumpy ride this year. However, some crypto aficionados out there have fared better than others, even if they held exactly the same altcoins and the same amounts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But how is that possible?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, one crypto dabbler just held their crypto in a wallet and the other popped that crypto on a lending platform and earnt </span><b>up to 18% APY</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whilst keeping all that exposure to the markets. But where is this Eldorado? Well, that would be </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/nexo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexo!</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep, Nexo is a top place to earn passive crypto income. But unlike other competitors like BlockFi, interest payments are actually </span><b>paid daily! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs pretty useful if you want the flexibility to take out your crypto from the lending platform at any time.</span>

		<Title>The Biggest Bubble of All</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest bubbles of our time is sitting right under our noses. A bubble that currently stands at a record $226 trillion and seems to be growing every day.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am of course talking about the global debt bubble. A massive burden that countries have made much worse through their pandemic restrictions and resulting government spending.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One that was actively inflated by central bankers around the world with their incredibly lax monetary policies. Governments, companies and households have gorged on debt in the hope that low rates would be the norm.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that is not how things are shaping up in 2022. Rates are going up and this could have far-reaching implications for all those debtors who have, until recently, been able to afford to service said debt.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What‚Äôs even more troubling than this is the fact that several analysts are predicting interest rates to go up much faster than the Fed has been saying. Could this be the start of an impending debt crisis? And how are the markets likely to react to this?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs all covered in my </span><a href="https://youtu.be/RK61FmQPTqw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video today!</span></a>

<b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned in my Telegram </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1567"><span style="font-weight: 400;">channel yesterday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I decided to pick up some LUNA. This was based on the fact that the price did not reflect the fundamentals. I used the remaining USDC in my portfolio to buy it.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There were no other changes to the portfolio. The updated position is:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 30.16% | BTC 23.07% | SOL 11.15% | DOT 10.27% | ATOM 6.21% | FTM 4.43% | HNT 2.99% | MATIC 2.12% | ADA 1.94% | RUNE 1.69% | LUNA 1.15% | AR 1.02% | YGG 0.91% | INJ 0.88% | UST 0.86% | LINK 0.84% | XDEFI 0.31%</span>

<b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 95.23% | Meebit 4.76%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just when you thought the crypto market was going to zero, it turns around and surprises you. It always happens that way, doesn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs no mystery either. Asset markets are driven by human emotion, and when you see </span><a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extreme lows in sentiment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a prolonged period of time like we have over the last 3 months, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before prices pump out of the blue.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be seen on the charts too. Since November, BTC has been in a </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wedge.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">descending wedge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or falling wedge on the daily. Descending wedges tend to break to the upside, and that‚Äôs basically because they signal that the downward momentum is losing steam. We‚Äôve not definitively broken out of this wedge to the upside, and that means more green days ahead (at least in theory).&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few macro factors at play here as well. Countries around the world are starting to ease pandemic restrictions, partially because </span><a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20220204/lockdowns-covid-deaths-study"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is starting to show that they do much more harm than good, and partially because the people have, quite frankly, had enough. This should lead to a further increase in workforce participation and consumer confidence.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On that note, it‚Äôs interesting that the crypto market pumped on the news of a relatively positive </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/592935-five-takeaways-on-a-stunning-jobs-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jobs report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the United States which was released on Friday. I‚Äôm not entirely sure why, but my best guess is that a strong economy means asset markets will have an easier time handling higher interest rates when the Federal Reserve starts raising them in March.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing that caught my eye is how much BTC pumped. It‚Äôs been a while since we‚Äôve seen BTC post double digit gains, and it managed to do so while more or less maintaining its </span><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">market dominance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that BTC is seen by some as a safe haven asset, this suggests that some investors are betting on </span><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/despite-jobs-blowout-heres-a-reason-to-bet-on-a-less-aggressive-fed-51644013802"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a less aggressive Fed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This explains the gold rally too.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there‚Äôs the metaverse cryptos. Some of you may remember hearing that Meta‚Äôs stock crashed by more than 25% in a day last week. Oddly enough, metaverse cryptos actually rallied in response, and a recent survey seems to explain why. In short, it seems like most people would </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/majority-of-us-consumers-say-no-to-meta-owning-metaverse-data-survey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prefer to interact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a decentralized metaverse world rather than one controlled by big tech.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From where I‚Äôm standing, it looks like the beginning of the end for web2, and not just big tech either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

<b>üìâ</b> <b>Collapse In Institutional Trust</b> <b>üìâ</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôll never forget the first part of the first section of </span><a href="https://youtu.be/hXp32pWkwqI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messari‚Äôs crypto predictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 2022. It highlighted the fact that trust in institutions is at an all-time low. Although the report anticipated that things would get worse before they get better in this regard, it didn‚Äôt anticipate just how rapidly the credibility of legacy institutions would decline in just the first month of the year.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs start with everyone‚Äôs favorite topic: the mainstream media.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As pointed out by crypto personality Anthony Pompliano </span><a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1478059547688374281?s=20&amp;t=9yYqIgwEo0JpUtEcBtQROg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, podcaster Joe Rogan basically has a larger listener base than the entirety of mainstream media combined. There are also dozens of alternative media sources, channels, and podcasts that frequently see more viewers in the ‚Äúkey demographic‚Äù (age 24-50) than mainstream news outlets like CNN, Fox News, etc.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People were surprised by this statistic (I certainly was), and that‚Äôs basically because it‚Äôs not all that obvious when you interact with many of these centralised platforms. Big tech is constantly propping up the mainstream media and mainstream talking points. There have been numerous investigations that have highlighted </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/google-tweaks-its-algorithm-to-change-search-results-wsj.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">potential bias.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How can they get away with this, you ask? Well, you can thank the politicians for that one. Big tech lobbying has </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18792/annual-lobbying-expenditures-of-major-tech-companies-in-the-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than doubled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the last few years, and is up more than 20x over the last decade depending on which company you‚Äôre talking about. The TLDR on lobbying is that companies give money to political candidates in exchange for favours. In this case, legal immunity.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lobbying is part of why the net worth </span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/nancy-pelosi/net-worth?cid=N00007360&amp;year=2018"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of many politicians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is hundreds, sometimes thousands of times more than their already hefty six-figure annual salaries. Another contributing factor is of course insider trading. Politicians know when laws, enforcement actions, and monetary stimulus are coming long before the public, and the end result is nothing short of free money for them.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And don‚Äôt even get me started about the </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revolving-door.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revolving door</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between politics and big business‚Ä¶&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the people who benefit most from this system quite like it the way it is, and they don‚Äôt want it to change. The only problem is that social and economic inequities are growing, and the best example is the </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-1-have-more-money-than-the-middle-class-2021-10"><span style="font-weight: 400;">October finding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the 1% now have more wealth than the entire middle class (60%) for the first time in history. That‚Äôs a wake-up call for everyone, regardless of their politics.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of these and other factors, the average person is starting to realize that the current system is seriously corrupt. As much as the algorithms attempt to suppress these realisations, they simultaneously amplify them, because today‚Äôs tech giants want engagement more than anything else, possibly even their own survival. This has resulted in </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/02/facebook-failing-to-protect-users-from-covid-misinformation-says-monitor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushback from their peers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The convenient consequence of this though is that the cat is thoroughly out of the bag. Today, everyone knows about insider trading. Everyone knows the pandemic restrictions ultimately </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/17/world-10-richest-men-see-their-wealth-double-during-covid-pandemic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made the rich richer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Everyone knows fiat currencies are losing value by the second. Everyone knows that laws aren‚Äôt applied equally. Everyone knows it's all bullshit, and they are pissed off.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where crypto comes in to fill the void - a world where code is law, and where freedom is the constitution. Most importantly, it‚Äôs a world which proves that there is an alternative to the status quo. This is a fact that those in control of the current world are desperately trying to suppress. </span><a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/590117-trust-in-democratic-governments-at-record-low-survey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not working</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it‚Äôs too late. The old world is collapsing, and a new one is coming.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üí∞</span> <b>Taxman Wants a Stake </b><b>üí∞</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the many reasons why doing crypto taxes is so hard is because one often does not know how exactly the taxman views particular crypto activities. This is particularly the case when it comes to staking and lending in Defi protocols.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There were two really interesting developments on that front this week and they came from both sides of the Atlantic.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, over in the US, you had an update </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/05/26/crypto-taxes-tax-rules-cryptocurrency-irs-joshua-jarrett/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that a crypto investor has with the IRS. As a bit of background, the individual in question (Josh Jarrett) sued the IRS because they denied his request for a refund on Tezos staking rewards. They offered to give him the refund in order to drop the suit but he </span><a href="https://twitter.com/nohardforks/status/1489222505000841219"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decided to press on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason that he did so was because without a ruling, there is no legal precedent. This means that Josh (and anyone who earns staking rewards) could still be taxed on this. Essentially, the IRS‚Äô treatment of staking rewards hangs in the balance with this lawsuit.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What‚Äôs pretty crazy about this is the fact that the IRS doesn‚Äôt actually have any guidance on staking rewards. It only has guidance when it comes to block rewards from people who use computing power to validate transactions (PoW miners). These mining rewards are taxable as income at the price of Bitcoin on the day that it is earned.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the argument that Jarret is trying to make is that these rewards should be treated as newly-created property that should only be taxed on the date that the property is disposed of. This would make the treatment of staking rewards akin to the other ‚Äútaxpayer discovered‚Äù property. This was exactly the point that those in the blockchain caucus </span><a href="https://schweikert.house.gov/sites/schweikert.house.gov/files/Final%20Proof%20of%20Stake%20IRS%20Letter%207.29.20.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argued in 2020.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite simply, if the IRS continues with current guidance and treats staking rewards like mining block rewards, it adds undue pressure on those staking. But, a judgement in Jarret‚Äôs favour could be a massive reprieve for all of those staking crypto.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, a little closer to home, the HMRC here in the UK decided to </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/cryptoassets-manual/crypto61214"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update its guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on staking and Defi lending.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most contentious points here is around the guidance for ‚Äúchargeable gains‚Äù. Quite simply, in its</span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/cryptoassets-manual/crypto61671"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> example</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, each time a cryptocurrency is lent (sent to a defi protocol) it could be counted as a ‚Äúdisposal event‚Äù and hence taxable. This is despite the fact that the individual still has full control of their crypto. Whether or not it is viewed like this will depend on if the returns were fixed or speculative and how regularly the returns were paid.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If HMRC does indeed read these events as a disposal, the implications for defi users could be massive. Think about a situation in which you lent ETH in some protocol near Ether‚Äôs all-time-high a few months ago. That would be counted as a ‚Äúdisposal‚Äù at the price that prevailed then. You would have to pay the capital gains tax on that ETH even though the price of ETH has fallen over 50% from the all time high!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not to mention the administrative nightmare that could come from this. You would have to go through all your defi lending activity and try to determine whether that individual transaction meets the criteria of a ‚Äúdisposal‚Äù. Then you will have to calculate the exact price that the cryptocurrency was on that date and disclose it!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There needs to be more clarity on this and it's a topic that I hope to cover more broadly when I have all the information.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you are based in the UK and have any concerns about this, then I would definitely recommend that you speak to your personal accountant or tax advisor.&nbsp;</span>

		<Title>Was That the Worst? Or More to Come??</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a brutal start to the year. Markets had fallen to levels not seen for months. Sentiment was down across the board‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when February came around, fortunes appeared to reverse. There was a much needed boost that seemed to pump sentiment across the board.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main question now is whether this is sustainable? Or is it more of a bull trap that many could get caught in? That‚Äôs exactly what two recent institutional crypto market reports have attempted to answer. And those reports are exactly what I will be covering today.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I will be breaking down their charts and stats and explaining exactly what they mean. I'll also analyse their key findings, as well as give you my own thoughts on their price and market predictions.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that</span> <a href="https://youtu.be/Dm_bGgkZ-os"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.&nbsp;</span></a>

<b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Took a bit of profit off the top of my ETH position as well as HNT and will be keeping this in UST. Apart from that, there are no more changes to my portfolio. As usual, all portfolio movements will be disclosed in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 31.12% | BTC 24.24% | SOL 9.73% | DOT 9.48% | ATOM 5.69% | FTM 4.31% | UST 2.37% | MATIC 2.20% | HNT 2.18% | ADA 1.91% | RUNE 1.49% | INJ 1.33% | LUNA 1.16% | AR 0.94% | LINK 0.80% | YGG 0.76% | XDEFI 0.28%</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs been another interesting week in the crypto market. What started out as a bullish breakout is now starting to look like a </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Vbjb-mGSMXo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bull trap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but I have a feeling we‚Äôre going to see some more positive price action later today. This is because in a few hours time, the Super Bowl will begin.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who don‚Äôt know, the Super Bowl is American football‚Äôs biggest event, and it attracts around 100 million viewers every year. This time around, </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/super-bowl-2022-commercials-cryptocurrency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be competing for the attention of these eyes with their ads. This could translate to positive price action for crypto.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only problem is that any parabolic runs could be cut short by our friends at the Fed. This is because there are concerns that they could react more aggressively when it comes to raising rates in March. Some see a </span><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-rate-hikes-51644606433"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.5% rate hike</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in response to the record inflation readings for January. </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-11/fed-doesn-t-yet-favor-a-half-point-hike-or-an-emergency-move"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is convinced this will happen, however.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This begs the question of what role cryptocurrency plays in this market dynamic. On the one hand, Bitcoin is supposed to be an inflation hedge. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs response to inflation seems to be having a negative impact on its price </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/02/09/bofa-says-bitcoin-trades-more-as-risk-asset-less-as-inflation-hedge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as if it was a stock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think a better way to see Bitcoin and crypto as a whole is as more of a fiat hedge rather than an inflation hedge. In other words, it‚Äôs a bet against the current financial system, and history suggests that‚Äôs not a bad bet to make. </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1587"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Blackrock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is getting its head in the game now.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This relates to an interesting trend I‚Äôve seen over the last week, and that‚Äôs a sharp rise in </span><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin dominance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Put simply, it looks like investors are rotating their altcoin gains into BTC. This could either be because we‚Äôre about to see a big crash, or Bitcoin is about to see some big news.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In either case, altcoins are getting slaughtered by this shift in capital, and as much as it‚Äôs probably harming your portfolio right now, consider it to be an opportunity to buy the dip on any cryptos you‚Äôre interested in (like I did). If you need help with that, check out </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Prkv45GfGUg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ü§Ø</span> <b>Craziest Story in Crypto&nbsp; </b><b>ü§Ø</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am sure that you folks have no doubt heard the story about the DOJ arrests and seizures in relation to the Bitfinex hack. It‚Äôs one of the craziest and most unlikely stories that I have seen in the crypto space recently - and that says </span><b>A LOT.&nbsp;</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that the whole saga can best be summed up with </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mattysino/status/1491360318135861248"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How on earth could an eccentric hipster couple from New York be charged with trying to launder over $4.5 billion in stolen cryptocurrency?&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There were so many other crazy details about this case, but here are just some of them:</span><b></b>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>The Cloud Drive:&nbsp; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine storing the private keys to 120,000 Bitcoin on a cloud drive?! How on earth could someone who used pretty sophisticated cyber laundering techniques commit one of the most noobish mistakes ever? It‚Äôs almost impossible to believe but yet, that‚Äôs how the agents were able to access it. A simple search warrant. A simple search. A decent $3.6 billion haul - the largest financial seizure </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of any kind</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ever!</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The Public Life</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: They were being traced by perhaps hundreds of agents from numerous three letter agencies. By blockchain analytics firms and other cyber security professionals with the best tools money can buy. And yet, they still had a public life plastered all over the internet. He was a VC and angel investor who until recently, regularly tweeted about Web 3. She was a rapper </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-38TQeQrQ88"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called Razzlekhan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who posted on TikTok, was a Forbes contributor and even </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1491338437043322880"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gave a talk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Social Engineering.&nbsp;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Not Accused of Hack: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they were in control of the Bitcoin and accused of trying to launder it, they are not accused of being the hackers. That means that either the authorities can‚Äôt prove they hacked it or someone else did and this couple seemed to have landed up with the crypto.&nbsp;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Who Gets the Funds</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The victim of the hack was of course Bitfinex. But it also impacted on the exchange‚Äôs users as they all had to take a haircut on balances at the time of the hack. This was eventually paid back but only in the USD value of the amounts lost at the time of the hack. Will the DOJ send the funds back to Bitfinex? The exchange </span><a href="https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4417401349657-2016-Security-Breach-Bitcoin-Recovery-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ-"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wants them back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but the DOJ has not indicated whether they are planning to return any of it. Let‚Äôs also not forget that US authorities still have concerns around the Bitfinex-Tether connection.&nbsp;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tracing it</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: As mentioned, the couple used some really </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1470186/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sophisticated techniques</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to try and obfuscate the funds. They used automated transaction batching, ‚Äúchain peeling‚Äù, chain hopping, dark-net markets and other mixers. Some of these transactions involved multiple hops and some of the chain hops involved using privacy preserving tech like Monero. Yet, the agents were still able to trace it and ultimately bring them down.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are only some of the most important facts and there is a lot more that needs to be uncovered. I hope to be doing a video on the topic in the coming week or so.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, the most important thing that I took away from this event is that cryptocurrency is not friendly to money launderers. Every single transaction on the blockchain is stored there immutably and forever. It doesn‚Äôt matter how long ago a theft occurred, the data is free for all to see and study.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is something that investigators would not have been able to do had the laundering being attempted with gold or cash. And this is exactly why the mainstream narrative around cryptocurrency and money laundering is tired. Times have changed and they need to change with the times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

<b>ü§´</b> <b>Cryptocurrency vs. Censorship</b> <b>ü§´</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of crazy news stories, you‚Äôve probably heard about the truckers protesting pandemic restrictions in Canada. This is something that‚Äôs come across my radar a few times over the last couple of weeks, but I didn‚Äôt pay too much attention until the headlines </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/92693/anti-vax-truckers-have-raised-700k-bitcoin-have-elon-musks-support"><span style="font-weight: 400;">started mentioning cryptocurrency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While I don‚Äôt have any interest in the protests per se, I am very interested in the financial censorship we‚Äôve seen from corporations and governments. It has put their financial powers on full display, and I see this as a very real test of whether crypto is truly </span><a href="https://bitcoinpasada.medium.com/back-to-basics-how-satoshi-designed-bitcoin-for-censor-resistance-fb00b795b35b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uncensorable money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But first, some background.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In late January, the organisers of the trucker protest started a GoFundMe page to crowdfund everything the truckers would need (food, fuel, accommodation, etc.). After raising 10 million dollars, GoFundMe </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/gofundme-removes-donation-page-for-canadian-truckers-protest"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pulled the page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under pressure from Canadian politicians.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the GoFundMe page was pulled, another crowdfunding website called GiveSendGo set up a few campaigns for the truckers, vowing not to bow to any political pressure. After raising almost another 10 million dollars, Canadian courts </span><a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8610512/givesendgo-fundraiser-trucker-convoy-frozen/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issued an order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to block payments from the platform.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Around this time, a crypto crowdfunding website called Tallycoin started accepting </span><a href="https://tallyco.in/s/lzxccm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC donations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on behalf of the truckers. It has raised nearly 1 million dollars so far, including from high profile people in the crypto community such as Kraken CEO Jesse Powell.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My question is, will these BTC donations be any different from its predecessors in practice?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrency is not legal tender in Canada, and this means it will need to be sold for fiat using a cryptocurrency exchange. It‚Äôs likely blockchain analytics companies </span><a href="https://youtu.be/KR5_6uVBRDU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are tracking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these BTC transactions closely, and they‚Äôll be able to alert Canadian authorities about any donated BTC.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At that point, the Canadian authorities will just ask the exchange to freeze the funds. If the exchange doesn‚Äôt comply, said authorities will likely freeze their bank accounts </span><a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/td-bank-to-hand-convoy-funds-to-court-as-organizers-turn-to-cryptocurrency-1.5778435"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the same way</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they recently did with the protestors who successfully received donations.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, it‚Äôs possible that these crypto payments could be processed by a bank that exists ‚Äúoutside‚Äù of the Canadian banking system. As it so happens, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_WQaRnqn4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some of the organisers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are using an independent provincial bank which is apparently sympathetic to their cause.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This would actually explain why the Federal Reserve is seemingly </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/90186/powell-lummis-spdi-kraken-wyoming%5C"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hesitating to approve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> licences for crypto banks in the USA. In any case, it‚Äôs clear that financial censorship is a powerful force, and even though crypto itself is uncensorable, the infrastructure used to interact with it is not.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever your opinions are about this protest, know that this is a very dangerous state of affairs, because the same suppression could just as easily be used against causes you deem to be just. This means it's more important than ever for crypto to create its own financial infrastructure.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs hope that happens sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</span>

<b>üî• Deal of The Week üî•</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs face it, those crypto markets are full of opportunities and many of you have devised your own trading strategies to take advantage. However, have you ever wondered how good that trading strategy was?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, you can keep running that strategy and learn from trial and error - that will likely cost you a boatload of money. OR you could test that secret trading methodology with paper trading.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This basically simulates real-time forward testing. Additionally, you can test that strategy with back testing, which shows your performance against historical price data. All that, gives you a much better idea of how effective that strategy actually is and enables you to make the necessary tweaks to optimise it!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But how do you do that? Well, you need some trading automation software! The one I use to refine my own crypto dabbling is </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/3commas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3Commas!</span></a>

		<Title>The CRAZIEST Story in Crypto!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been in the crypto space for quite some time. And yet, this story has to be one of the craziest that I have yet encountered.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs the story of those infamous BitFinex money launderers who managed to evade capture for over 6 years. All this while living in plain sight of the regulators and law enforcement agencies that were hot on their tail. Individuals who were the antithesis of what you would expect of sophisticated cybercriminals.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The story was covered extensively in the press. However, what I found most interesting about it is the lengths that the authorities went to trace them and how they managed to bring them down. So today, I will be breaking down the case. All the way from how the hack took place to how the authorities managed to track down the stolen funds.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also a number of other mysteries that surround this story. Mysteries that play a central part in not only how the funds were distributed, but whether they were returned at all.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a fascinating video to break down so I hope you enjoy it. You can watch it </span><a href="https://youtu.be/5eSAULOtuTg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over here.¬†¬†</span></a>

<b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes to the portfolio this week. Hodling tight given that there appears to be a great deal of </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1494013515136475138"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macro uncertainty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ahead of us for the next 2 weeks or so. I will of course keep you guys posted in my Telegram channel if there are any changes.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre wondering why the crypto market has been so wonky lately, I can explain in one word: uncertainty. There is nothing investors hate more than uncertainty. The content of the news doesn‚Äôt even necessarily matter. If it‚Äôs bad news, it can be priced in. If it‚Äôs good news, it can be priced in. If nobody knows what the news is or is going to be, that </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15427560.2020.1867551?journalCode=hbhf20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creates volatility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These days there is no shortage of macro factors causing uncertainty. First and foremost, there‚Äôs the uncertainty around how much the Federal Reserve is going to raise interest rates in March. The March meeting is only a few weeks away, and investors are expecting a 0.5% rate hike. I personally don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see interest rates rise above 1% before something breaks, just based on </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this trend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another macro factor at play is the ongoing supply chain issues that are putting a dent in economies around the world. Although many of these are due to pandemic restrictions, there‚Äôs an interesting theory I heard </span><a href="https://youtu.be/01vMtJUknwo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on a podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other day. Basically, people have changed their spending habits because of the pandemic, and this is creating unexpected bottlenecks.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there‚Äôs the prospect of another major war as a result of the tension between Russia and Ukraine. This is a whole can of worms that I discuss a bit more below, but I should note that this isn‚Äôt the only point of tension as far as global conflict goes. The United States seems to be revving up its engines </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/594514-pelosi-vows-us-will-fight-with-israel-against-terrorism-posed-by-iran"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the middle east</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few factors specific to crypto that are causing uncertainty as well. For starters there‚Äôs the formation of a </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/fbi-form-new-digital-currency-unit-justice-dept-taps-new-crypto-czar-2022-02-17/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto specific unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the FBI which will scan cryptocurrency blockchains for any suspicious activities and seek to seize funds wherever possible. Call me crazy, but I have a feeling that this recovered crypto will be sold at auction to institutional investors in the future.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally we have the </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/biden-expected-to-issue-executive-order-on-crypto-and-cbdcs-next-week-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">upcoming executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the US president which pertains to cryptocurrencies and CBDCs. Plans for the executive order were first revealed late last month, and it looks like it might finally be put in place next week. All we know for now is that it will instruct various regulators to assess the risks and benefits of these technologies.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üá∫üá¶</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬† </span><b>War &amp; Crypto¬† </b><b>üá∑üá∫</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems as if one of the biggest geo-political risks on the table right now is the prospect of a war between Russia and Ukraine.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the broader question is: What impact could a war have on crypto?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the immediate impact of any hostilities could lead to a large scale ‚Äúrisk off‚Äù sentiment in global financial markets. This is something that we have already been seeing over the past few¬† days. Stock markets have </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-markets-dow-update-02-17-2022-11645087523"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been falling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> globally and this has also been driving the crypto markets lower.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are pivoting out of these risky assets into perceived safe havens like treasuries, gold and even cash. This is likely to continue in the event that there actually is a large-scale invasion. How far it will fall is hard to tell. However, I do think that it won‚Äôt be as severe as the stock market / crypto routes that we saw in the Covid crashes of 2020.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, when it comes to crypto-specific impacts, there are quite a few things that we should be looking out for.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, in terms of demand to hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a full blown war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to capital flight out of their respective currencies. We have already seen this with the fall in the value of these currencies over the past few days. As Russians and Ukraininins try to preserve their purchasing power, they could attempt to move it into crypto.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Ukraine, the country </span><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranks highly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in global adoption tables and has </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/14/business/crypto-ukraine.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been trying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fuel this growth over the past year. This has further been cemented this week as the Ukrainian parliament </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-17/ukrainian-parliament-adopts-law-legalizing-cryptocurrencies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to legalise cryptocurrency. Given that they have easy access to crypto services, there could be a flood of people who attempt to sell their hryvnia in return for Bitcoin.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, when it comes to Russians, crypto could also be a safe haven. Russia could suffer sanctions which would cut it off from dollar clearing. This could make it impossible for Russians to convert their rubles into foreign currency to preserve their savings. Bitcoin is much easier to buy in RUB and would allow them to ‚Äúoffshore‚Äù their savings with crypto.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs also pretty likely that ultra high net worth oligarchs could be sanctioned. These include some of those linked to Putin‚Äôs inner circle. These individuals would also look for alternative methods of making their vast wealth liquid and outside of the reach of other countries.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while there could be more demand to hold Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies from these countries, there could also be an impact on the Bitcoin network. That‚Äôs because a war could lead to a greater cost of operation and potential disruption of Bitcoin miners.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if Russia does invade Ukraine, this could lead to oil &amp; energy prices skyrocketing. If Russia‚Äôs energy sector is sanctioned, then you will have less supply which, with constant demand will mean higher prices. Europe is already struggling with energy costs and is heavily reliant on Russian gas.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, higher energy prices mean more costs for the Bitcoin miners. In fact, this risk of rising energy prices is something that I talked about in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rex-h4vkELs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a video last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the energy crisis gets so bad in these countries then it‚Äôs even possible that miners either shut down rigs or the grids ration power away from the miners.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We should also not forget that Russia makes up </span><a href="https://prnt.sc/uGZiOMR6991c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a sizable portion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the global hashrate with over 13% emanating from the country. Any disruptions in energy to these miners could lead to a fall in that hashrate as they go offline.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs also possible that this spills over beyond Russia‚Äôs borders and impacts on energy supply to neighbouring countries. Perhaps the biggest risk here is any impact on miners in Kazakhstan. They contribute the </span><a href="https://prnt.sc/8owf6C1ckkHn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second most</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to global hash rate and we have already seen the network impact when these miners </span><a href="http://i"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are put offline.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Falling hash rate means reduced security, higher transaction fees and slower transactions.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While that is concerning, I still think that as a longer term hedge and store of value, Bitcoin &amp; cryptocurrency is one of the best assets to hold. Yes, it's going to be a volatile ride as it's swept up in market hysteria. But, what I care about is how things look when the ride is done. Eventually, fundamental value is borne out.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the Canadian government invoked a controversial law for the first time in response to the protests against pandemic restrictions taking place in the country‚Äôs capital. The Emergencies Act gives the Canadian government unprecedented powers, and in this case it used those powers to </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60383385"><span style="font-weight: 400;">freeze the bank accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of both protestors and the supporters of the protests.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after the emergency law went into effect, Canadian banks saw a sudden </span><a href="https://twitter.com/JamesMelville/status/1494092820260532227?s=20&amp;t=Mtl9Wc_YR6tE-HMWNMTE1Q"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spike in outages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is believed to have been caused by citizens frantically withdrawing their money. This is likely because nobody knows what the threshold is for their bank accounts to be frozen. The prime minister actually </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAOGkd2Xpv8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">refused to clarify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what the criteria are during parliamentary debates.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To make matters worse, a full list of the donors to the crowdfunding campaign for the protests was </span><a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/civil-servants-nasa-employees-and-an-american-billionaire-among-donors-leaked-in-givesendgo-hack"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaked by hackers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a day before the government invoked the Emergencies Act. This means the Canadian government conveniently has a list of financial supporters it could target. Those who oppose the protests have taken matters into their own hands by </span><a href="https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/threats-close-stella-luna-gelato-cafe-after-owners-name-appears-in-givesendgo-data-leak"><span style="font-weight: 400;">targeting supporters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the crypto world, the Emergencies Act made the headlines because it also included a ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù on roughly 40 cryptocurrency wallets associated with the protests. The crypto media was quick to </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-community-condemns-canada-for-freezing-dissidents-bitcoin-wallets"><span style="font-weight: 400;">point out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that this wasn‚Äôt a freeze of cryptocurrency wallets, but an instruction to crypto-fiat on/off ramps to watch out for transactions from those wallets and freeze them if and when they come.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While these events have inspired admittedly awesome memes such as </span><a href="https://www.cryptonicle.com/justin-trudeau-announced-as-new-vp-of-marketing-at-bitcoin-foundation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they are simultaneously a terrifying glimpse into what awaits if and when central bank digital currencies are rolled out. The difference is that there will be no need for any emergency measures to enact these kinds of policies. As I‚Äôve mentioned </span><a href="https://youtu.be/7Lu0uhrueWI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in my videos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this will be the default setting for CBDCs.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, anyone who opposes the government will be frozen out of the financial system, and as Kraken CEO Jesse Powell </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1494462097161220104?s=20&amp;t=F8xj4KIzSoH3amT60PYwLg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, any crypto-fiat on/off ramps will be forced to comply on the fiat side. The only protection will be decentralised finance solutions which have immutable and (hopefully) fair laws built into the code according to Ethereum founder </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/19/vitalik-buterin-calls-canadas-use-of-banks-to-stifle-protestors-dangerous/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitalik Buterin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What these events have made clear however is that it‚Äôs not just the ability to transact, but the ability to transact privately that matters. This is something I mentioned in my video about the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/EqsTuaLRGuk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">worst case scenario</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for cryptocurrencies. Without privacy, financial freedom is not possible, because you can always be coerced in other ways. Let this be a wake up call to the world.¬†</span>

This new show is in collaboration with iHeartPodcasts and is co-hosted by my childhood friend, Mad Mike!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In it, Mike and I talk about all things crypto and give you the lowdown about all things in the cryptoverse, with none of the hype!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interested in my crypto banter with Mike and hearing our educational insights? Well, check out our </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/41TtLE0AKsokP5XBbSoLwe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first episode</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where we tell you what money really is!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs been a pretty rough week in crypto land and if you are like me then you have been holding on for dear life. However, did you know that there is a way to earn while you HODL that digital gold?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep, you could use a crypto lending platform to retain all that price exposure and </span><b>earn interest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the same time.¬†</span>

<a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/nexo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Nexo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can earn up to </span><b>18% interest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on dozens of different cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH and a plethora of different alts. Even better, those interest payments are made daily. So, unlike other lending platforms (which payout monthly) you won‚Äôt have to worry about losing that crypto interest if you quickly want to reallocate some of that crypto into a hot altcoin you have discovered.¬†</span>

		<Title>Crypto‚Äôs BIGGEST Risks To Stability</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are the cryptocurrency markets a risk to broader financial market stability? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, according to a recent report by the folks at the Financial Stability Board (FSB), they could indeed be. In the report, they analyse the size and scope of the current crypto market and break down the potential risks they foresee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not one to simply dismiss something as FUD, I thought that the report was well worth examining in greater detail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs exactly what I am going to be doing today. I will be breaking down the relevant sections and outlining whether I think that these risks are warranted or not. I will also be giving my perspective on some market risks that are not covered in the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/pYB0zprAByU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.</span></a></p>
<p><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some minor changes to the portfolio this week. I sold some of my DOT &amp; SOL. Part of this has gone into UST and the rest has been used to buy some more LUNA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for the latter move has been recent developments in the Terra ecosystem that have made me increasingly bullish. This includes the likes of that $1 billion ecosystem fund that was announced </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1639"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this week.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current portfolio:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 31.20% | BTC 23.58% | SOL 8.88% | DOT 8.77% | ATOM 6.40% | FTM 3.99% | UST 3.17% | LUNA 2.75% | MATIC 2.08% | HNT 2.03% | ADA 1.70% | RUNE 1.50% | INJ 1.18% | AR 0.89% | YGG 0.86% | LINK 0.76% | XDEFI 0.26%</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 96.73% | Meebit 3.27%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congratulations on making it through what might be the most intense week since the crypto crash in </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/bitcoin-loses-half-of-its-value-in-two-day-plunge.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when the pandemic was declared. Today we‚Äôre faced with similar amounts of uncertainty due to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. As I‚Äôve mentioned before, there‚Äôs nothing markets hate more than uncertainty, and this dynamic explains the crypto market‚Äôs movements. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Russia invaded Ukraine last Wednesday, asset markets across the board took a massive dip, with crypto </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/93697/crypto-market-cap-falls-11-following-russias-invasion-of-ukraine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taking the brunt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of blow. This caused over </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/24/crypto-sees-242m-in-liquidations-within-hours-amid-russia-ukraine-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">240 million dollars </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in liquidations for leveraged crypto traders who were somehow convinced that crypto would continue to rally amid all this uncertainty. This automated selling caused crypto prices to crash even further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But by Thursday, the crypto market started to recover, and </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/25/bitcoins-implied-volatility-suggests-recovery-set-to-continue/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some indicators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggest this recovery will continue. This is simply because investors had some semblance of certainty: they knew for sure that Russia had invaded, so they could plan accordingly. Not only that, but by Friday most of </span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/25/list-of-sanctions-on-russia-after-invasion"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the sanctions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that were likely to be levied against Russia had been put in place - more certainty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real question is what happens next. As I‚Äôve mentioned a few times on Instagram, I‚Äôm concerned that we will see other countries take advantage of this chaos to make their own moves (you know </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/taiwan-warns-chinese-aircraft-in-its-air-defense-zone.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs also not yet clear whether the world will go as far as sanctioning </span><a href="https://time.com/6151493/russia-oil-gas-embargo-sanctions-ukraine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russian oil exports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> given that energy prices are already through the roof. There is also the question about whether they will kick Russian banks out of the SWIFT system and whether that could drive Russia to find alternative methods to bypass this (more on that next).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then of course, there is the million dollar question of what the Fed will do in its much-anticipated March meeting. Much of the expectation around interest rate increases came before the eruption of war in Ukraine. It seems as if the market has </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/23/the-market-has-adjusted-its-views-of-how-the-federal-reserve-will-raise-interest-rates.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adjusted expectations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down and that we could only see a 0.25% increase after the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will ultimately depend on what the February inflation numbers look like. The problem is that this war could further exacerbate the supply chain disruptions and further increase energy prices - both not good for inflation. This could still force the Fed‚Äôs hand and cause it to act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there are surprises to the upside or downside with the expected rate hikes, expect to see crypto move together with the rest of the financial markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üíπ </span><b>Sanctions, Finance &amp; Crypto üíπ</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Russia has finally decided to invade Ukraine, western sanctions on the country are beginning to ramp up. One that has often </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60521822"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been cited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be the most damaging is the exclusion of Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those that don‚Äôt know, this is the global messaging system that acts as an intermediary for all global cross border payments. By being excluded from this network, Russian banks (and banks that deal with them) would have to find alternative ways to route money. It has been called the ‚Äúnuclear option‚Äù because of how much damage it could do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of right now, it seems as if numerous countries are </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/26/eu-uk-canada-us-pledge-to-remove-selected-russian-banks-from-swift.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showing their support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for doing this. However, some people are saying that should this in fact happen, it would force Russia to find alternative methods of payment and alternative payment systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, this has led many people to openly </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/business/russia-sanctions-cryptocurrency.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">start suggesting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the country could turn towards cryptocurrency payments to avert these. They‚Äôre permissionless and there are no centralised entities that can exclude a country from being able to use them. Indeed, there are countries like North Korea &amp; Iran that have </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-nkorea-grows-nuclear-missiles-programs-profits-cyberattacks-un-report-2022-02-05/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of using cryptocurrencies to bypass financial sanctions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1497158860427071490"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not too happy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about this eventuality. That‚Äôs because it will further add weight to the arguments of governments as to the supposed ills of cryptocurrency. No one wants to see a technology facilitating war and destruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this got me actively thinking: Would Russia even consider this? And if it did, could it actually work?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, as it pertains to the former, Putin </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/putin-defends-cryptocurrencies-amid-global-regulation-push"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that crypto ‚Äúhas the right to exist and can be used as a means of payment‚Äù. However, he also said that it was too soon to consider crypto as a method of payment for the country‚Äôs oil exports. Yet, the fact that he even acknowledged its benefits shows that it has been on his mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, even if Russia did decide to do that, I think it would have a very hard time using crypto. This is for a number of reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Transparency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The blockchain is fully transparent. All addresses that are linked to Russian banks or oil companies can </span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2018/treasury-department-cryptocurrency-regulation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">be sanctioned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Any payments that emanate from these addresses can be </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR5_6uVBRDU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly traced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and identified. These will automatically be tainted and very hard to sell. Anyone who buys it will have to get it at a considerable discount.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Liquidity: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if there are buyers willing to accept tainted cryptocurrency, the volume they could accept would be insignificant. In fact, it is likely to be a pittance compared with the billions of daily oil and energy trade that Russia does.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Volatility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Crypto is still quite volatile and it would be hard for these companies to plan for payments. This is in fact the main criticism that Putin has with crypto. Even if Russia tries to use stablecoins, the centralised variants can </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/13/tether-freezes-160m-of-usdt-stablecoin-on-ethereum-blockchain/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily be frozen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, this should put our minds at ease about the potential for crypto being used for these illicit purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, it‚Äôs way more likely that cryptocurrency will emerge from this conflict with a much more positive narrative driving it. Crypto fundraising efforts for Ukrainians have </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/4point1-million-in-cryptocurrency-funneled-to-ukrainian-military-since-russia-invaded.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been surging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as people try to find ways of getting money to those in the resistance. The Ukrainian government is in fact </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Ukraine/status/1497594592438497282"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly fundraising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the effort on Twitter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citizens in Ukraine are also using crypto </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/93827/crypto-exchange-volumes-in-ukraine-spike-as-currency-controls-introduced"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a means</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to bypass the country‚Äôs currency controls. As I mentioned in my newsletter last week, crypto could provide a means for people to get their money out of the unstable hryvnia. Scenes of people </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/02/24/ukrainians-flood-atms-to-withdraw-cash-as-russian-war-begins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">waiting outside</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ATMs with limited cash in them further reinforces the need for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, crypto is just technology that can be used for good or evil. But, it's a technology that could also allow people to easily discern good from bad.</span></p>
<p><b>ü§´</b> <b>The Fourth Turning</b> <b>ü§´</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As some of you will know, I love to read and listen to podcasts whenever I have the time. Over the last few months I‚Äôve heard a term repeated that I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about. It‚Äôs called ‚Äò</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fourth Turning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äô, and it‚Äôs a theory which states that the world sees a serious crisis every 100 years or so that results in some serious changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fourth Turning is more than just a theory. It‚Äôs also a </span><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hard-times-create-strong-men"><span style="font-weight: 400;">famous meme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: hard times make strong men, strong men make good times, good times make weak men, weak men make hard times. Similar concepts can also be found in famous hedge fund manager </span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/52962238-the-changing-world-order"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ray Dalio‚Äôs new book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called ‚ÄòThe Changing World Order‚Äô which I have heard a lot about but have admittedly not read (yet).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, the idea is what matters: every so often something happens and there‚Äôs a radical shift in the way the world works. From where I‚Äôm standing, the radical change we‚Äôre seeing is one towards either extreme centralisation or extreme decentralisation. There‚Äôs a lot to unpack here, but I‚Äôll keep it as brief as I can. Let‚Äôs start from ‚Äúthe beginning‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020#:~:text=WHO%20has%20been%20assessing%20this,be%20characterized%20as%20a%20pandemic.]"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 11th, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the day the World Health Organisation declared that the world is in a pandemic. The responses that followed from governments around the world were unprecedented, and did three things. First, they </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/how-the-pandemic-revealed-the-fragility-of-supply-chains/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exposed how fragile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the world‚Äôs supply chains are. Put differently, they showed how dependent countries have become on each other for even the most basic things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second thing pandemic responses did was shatter public trust in existing institutions, specifically the government and the </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/575692-trust-in-media-nears-record-low-gallup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainstream media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The alarming amount of coordination between these two, as well as </span><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nataliebettendorf/fauci-emails-covid-response"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media platforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, made people question whether the narratives being spun were to protect them, or to protect the machine and the people in power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third thing pandemic responses did was expose how the current financial system works, namely that when money is printed, </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60015294"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the wealthy and Wall Street</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seem to be the first recipients of this capital. Meanwhile, regular people lose their purchasing power, and with much of the planet stuck at home with nothing to do, people started to notice, and </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriscarosa/2021/04/03/how-the-pandemic-actually-increased-financial-literacy/?sh=7a9559915559"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial literacy increased</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of these and other events, the world is now at a crossroads on three major fronts. First, do countries become more self-reliant? If they become more self-reliant, they become less efficient and potentially less prosperous. If they don‚Äôt become more self-reliant, they remain efficient but also vulnerable to global disruptions of all kinds while weakening global ties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, do countries allow the free flow of information? If they do, then trust in institutions will continue to decline, because there will be no shared narrative for the people to rally around, and this means the country itself could collapse. If they don‚Äôt, then it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the people find out they‚Äôre being lied to, and this could result in a revolution or worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third, do countries decentralise their money or do they centralise it further? If they decentralise it, then they no longer have control over monetary policy and run the risk of foreign financial influence. If they centralise it further, then they open the door to a totalitarian system unlike any other, because it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it falls into the wrong hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call me crazy, but I think what we‚Äôre seeing around the world right now can be summed up as a conflict between the people who want the former three (interdependence, control of information, control of money) and the people who want the latter three (independence, free flow of information, open money). Which side will win? Who knows, but I know which one I‚Äôm on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a lot of talk about ‚Äúself custody‚Äù recently. Especially in light of the attempts of some countries to freeze crypto that is held on certain centralised exchanges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are thinking about taking full control of your crypto, then you will want the gold standard of private key security. I am of course talking about a hardware wallet. And, when it comes to hardware wallets, there are quite a few options on it - as detailed in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t3Brlb0qzQ&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But which hardware wallet do I use to keep Coin Bureau‚Äôs version of Gringotts safe? Well, that would be a </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/trezor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor hardware wallet!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Here you can store over 1,000 different cryptos. So, the chances are that even your most avid altcoin dabbler is going to be able to store their entire portfolio here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need help setting up your Trezor then I take you through the steps </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUBid1zJC-U"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here!</span></a></p>

		<Title>The NEXT Mega Trade!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Could we be on the cusp of the next mega crypto trade?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs the question that was recently asked by the folks over at Pantera Capital. Their February investor letter may have been lost in the noise of geo-politics over the past two weeks.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs unfortunate, as I found it to be one of the most compelling cases yet for a great reversal of crypto prices. A massive rally where people could benefit from a mega trade.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you missed that blockchain letter, then my video today is essential viewing. I take you through all of the most important points and break down the analysis with my own commentary.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I also share my own thoughts on where the market is going and how recent geopolitical events are likely to play out for the crypto markets.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here.¬†</span>

<b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Few changes to the portfolio this week. Sold off a bit of DOT &amp; MATIC. I bought a bit more RUNE (more on that below) and left the rest in UST.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, it was another volatile week in the crypto market. Everything was looking good on Monday and Tuesday, but come Wednesday everything started to crash. What‚Äôs interesting is that the crypto market started crashing at 10am CET on the dot, which is when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell began his </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/02/fed-chair-powell-notes-highly-uncertain-ukraine-impact-but-says-rate-hikes-are-still-coming.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of testimony about the state of the US economy.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday at 10am CET, Jerome began his </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-prices-europe-jerome-powell-c0094ad1f073f0442ef7d31ac4c1b77c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of testimony. Lo and behold, the crypto market crashed again and so did the S&amp;P 500 Stock Market Index. Then came Friday, which saw the release of the </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jobs report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for February at 8:30am. Like clockwork, the crypto market and stock market crashed because the report found significant job growth in the month before.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre wondering why the markets would crash on that kind of news, the answer is the Federal Reserve. Its mandate is to ensure ‚Äúmaximum employment‚Äù and ‚Äústable prices‚Äù through monetary policy. With maximum employment seemingly taking place, this means the Federal Reserve will focus more on stable prices through </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-policy-pivot-track-despite-uncertain-impact-ukraine-war-powell-says-2022-03-02/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising interest rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôll be talking more about the effects the Fed is having on the crypto market when I cover what Jerome said during his two testimonies later this week. Right now I want to alert you of an interesting phenomenon we saw in the crypto market late last week as it crashed. As some of you may have noticed, BTC dominance was </span><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trending upwards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the last 2 weeks.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although BTC dominance is still trending upwards, when the crypto market crashed, BTC dominance saw a sudden dip. This suggests most of the money that left the crypto market late last week was people selling off their BTC rather than altcoins. This is strange because BTC dominance tends to spike rather than fall when prices drop since BTC is safe relative to altcoins.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On-chain analysis supports this theory too - the BTC </span><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=distribution.BalanceExchangesRelative"><span style="font-weight: 400;">balances on exchanges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have ticked up slightly over the last week or so, indicating that BTC holders were selling. This begs the question of why all that BTC was sold, and though I certainly can‚Äôt say for sure, I do have a few theories. One thing is for sure; it‚Äôs not all the retail that FOMO‚Äôd in at the top. They‚Äôve </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/94184/most-bitcoin-investors-bought-at-all-time-high-have-sold"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already sold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This leaves a few possibilities. The most likely seems to be that some Russian citizens are starting to sell their crypto because of how much crypto exchanges are </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cexs-refuse-blanket-asset-freeze-of-all-russian-users-though-questions-linger"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being pressured</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ban them due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. This could be undoing a lot of the buying pressure that was initially coming from Russians when the sanctions started settling in and the Ruble fell.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The second possibility relates to the first, and that‚Äôs the selling of donated cryptocurrency by the Ukrainian government for other assets to help fight against Russian aggression. The Ukrainian government has received </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/03/ukraine-raises-54-million-as-bitcoin-donations-surge-amid-russian-war.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 50 million dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in donations over the last week, and with crypto balances on exchanges being as low as they are, this could be all it takes to move markets.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The third possibility is likewise a part of the former two, and that‚Äôs concerns around the Russia-Ukraine conflict, specifically the narrative that cryptocurrency could be used to </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-could-bypass-president-biden-s-devastating-sanctions-on-russian-banks-and-elites-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evade sanctions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the crackdown on the industry that could result because of this. I explained why this wouldn‚Äôt work in last week‚Äôs newsletter. TLDR: ‚Äúsounds good, doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù.¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it doesn‚Äôt work though, it‚Äôs pretty clear that governments and regulators are going to use that excuse as a means to apply pressure to hosted cryptocurrency service providers.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, this is something that I talked about extensively last year‚Ä¶</span>

<b>üîê</b> <b>Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins</b> <b>üîê</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After falling down the rabbit hole of the Financial Action Task Force </span><a href="https://youtu.be/cZyTDJPnp14"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I knew it was only a matter of time before regulators around the world started coming for self-custodial crypto wallets. In other words, before they moved to absorb crypto into the same financial system it was designed to replace.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I predicted that the first jurisdictions to enforce regulations against the self-custody of crypto would be the ones with the strictest regulations, and my prediction recently came true. South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1496995862010265600?s=20&amp;t=zlcPkGQkx8Qyfhch4uOeGQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it will be blocking all withdrawals to personal wallet addresses, leaving only domestic exchanges and other platforms with KYC.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While we have yet to see the same sort of regulations being pushed in other countries, some of you may recall the recent debacle involving Trezor </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/trezor-removes-controversial-address-verification-protocol-other-wallets-follow-suit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over a tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allowed users to connect their personal identities to their crypto wallet addresses. As many of you will know, crypto wallets are supposed to be pseudonymous because privacy is necessary for true financial freedom.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor removed the controversial tool after pushback from the crypto community, but I see it as one of the first warning shots of an upcoming war for self-custody in cryptocurrency. I have a feeling that the battleground for this will be in the United States, because of some of the comments certain politicians made about crypto wallets </span><a href="https://youtu.be/L-eZrMpv1CE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">during Jerome‚Äôs testimony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This concerning trend to do away with self-custody in cryptocurrency is part of why </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1499450281859366918"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôm so bullish</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on crypto projects like Thorchain. Thorchain makes it possible to seamlessly trade different cryptocurrencies between blockchains the same way you would on a centralised exchange, except everything is completely decentralised. You can learn more about the project </span><a href="https://youtu.be/UHomN1E0ztQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, even though crypto projects like Thorchain will eventually be able to address all the cross-chain aspects to cryptocurrency, this unfortunately won‚Äôt be enough to mitigate the incoming crackdown on self custody. That‚Äôs because getting in and out of the crypto ecosystem requires interacting with a </span><a href="https://youtu.be/r4qSKvhjgQQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">centralised exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of some kind, and that‚Äôs a big problem.¬†¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre wondering why, look no further than what happened in Canada. The government instructed all cryptocurrency exchanges to freeze transactions coming from crypto wallets belonging to protestors, and as Kraken CEO Jesse Powell explained, they have </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/svcqaj/kraken_ceo_jesse_powell_if_you_worried_about_your/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no choice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but to comply. As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing a similar situation unfold with Russian citizens.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, whatever you think about the protests in Canada or the war in Ukraine, one thing is clear: the government should not be allowed to have this amount of power, even if it‚Äôs being used in a way that everyone agrees to be just. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs only a matter of time before someone bad gets behind the wheel, and then crypto will be the same as </span><a href="https://youtu.be/7Lu0uhrueWI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">central bank digital currencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that everyone is starting to realise this, but the bad news is that nobody knows what to do about it, at least not yet. For what it‚Äôs worth, there‚Äôs still lots of time before we see any significant moves against self custody in most countries.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime it‚Äôs important we tackle another important problem, and that‚Äôs the points of centralisation within cryptocurrency itself - and that brings me onto my next topic‚Ä¶</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">üßê </span><b>Decentralised Web3 (Sort of) üßê</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, something happened that had me really worried about the truly permissionless and decentralised nature of Web3. One was the ban of Iranian IPs by Opensea and the other was the block of Venezuelan IPs by Metamask - actions that go against the spirit of decentralised, permissionless networks.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what happened?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, when it comes to Opensea, Iranian users </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mondoir/status/1499425612687101957"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they were unable to access their accounts. It was later </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/03/opensea-bars-iranian-users-as-us-sanctions-talk-ramps-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Opensea that they had started to block users from those countries that had been sanctioned by the US, of which Iran is one. Essentially, a ‚Äúdecentralised‚Äù marketplace was censoring anonymous users based on the location of their IP addresses.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This quite rightly caused an uproar in the Web3 community, but you also can‚Äôt really blame Opensea. It‚Äôs a US-based company and assisting with sanctions violation is a crime - with pretty severe penalties. Let‚Äôs not forget that BitMEX was hit with massive penalties on the grounds that it was </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-crime-bitmex-idUSKBN26N08O"><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing its platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Iranian traders.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, what this does show is that Web3 is not as decentralised as you think. Moreover, who determines the criteria for censoring IPs? Today it was innocent Iranian collectors, tomorrow it may be citizens in Russia or Belarus?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But this is perhaps less concerning than the blockage of Metamask services for those Venezuelans.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was also </span><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/136256/venezuelan-users-of-crypto-wallet-metamask-say-they-can-no-longer-access-it"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that users in that country were unable to access Metamask. This turned out to be </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1499448226180583429"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a mistake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the part of Infura, the default infrastructure provider that Metamask uses to access the Ethereum blockchain. Infura also confirmed this </span><a href="https://twitter.com/infura_io/status/1499446960725512202"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but also revealed that it was in fact involved in geo-blocking certain IPs.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is concerning. It shows that even though the Ethereum blockchain is decentralised, if there are centralised gatekeepers, they can still make it difficult for you to access that blockchain. And while it may just be the sanctions list right now, what‚Äôs to stop overzealous regulators from casting the dragnet wider?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The simple workaround in this case was of course just to manually edit the RPC endpoints on Metamask. But it still leaves the question of a reliance on such a centralised service.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of Ethereum dApps and wallets use Infura as the default solution to connect to the blockchain. Not only do they run the risks that user IPs are blocked, but they also have to trust that the information coming from the company is 100% accurate. This episode reminded me of that really interesting </span><a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Founder of Signal around the centralisation of Web3.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In that post, he specifically mentioned the centralisation of Infura or Alchemy and how many dApps rely on it. He also talked about the backend architecture of Opensea and how it integrates with web wallets. He expanded on the concerns of how much these wallets rely on Opensea‚Äôs representation of an NFT.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Web3 definitely does have centralised points that when pressured, can impact on our ability to use the network.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And speaking of which, there were also </span><a href="https://protos.com/consensys-lawsuit-jpmorgan-owns-critical-ethereum-infrastructure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a lawsuit which accused Consensys (the owner of Metamask &amp; Infura) of selling an ‚Äúinfluential‚Äù stake of the aforementioned products to JP Morgan. The lawsuit alleges, quite simply, that JP Morgan owns a sizable stake in the IP of these two products.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I will stress of course that these are just accusations. But it would be quite an ironic twist if one of the poster boys of traditional finance could one day actually have a say in the development of these products.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a court case that we should no be keeping a close eye on.¬†</span>

		<Title>What The FED Has Coming!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we have one of the most important Fed meetings of the year. That‚Äôs because in this meeting, the Fed‚Äôs board is expected to start increasing interest rates.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it's how aggressively they are planning to do so that could determine the trajectory of all markets including cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how is this meeting likely to go?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it's hard to tell. That‚Äôs because the current macroeconomic backdrop is uncertain and things are changing by the day.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, one of our best bets to ascertain which way this meeting could go is through the comments made by Jerome Powell. And, from a recent congressional testimony by the man himself, we have over 2 hours of insight to examine.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs exactly what I will be covering today! I will be breaking down this testimony into its most important parts and giving you my take on what this could mean for the markets.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, if you want to get the bird‚Äôs eye view of what could go down this week, then it‚Äôs a video you can‚Äôt afford to miss.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that here.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes to the portfolio this week. Conditions were too volatile and I was just happy to hodl my stacks. There are a few coins / tokens which I am considering adding and I will keep you updated in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 30.28% | BTC 24.51% | DOT 8.54% | SOL 8.32% | ATOM 6.29% | UST 3.65% | RUNE 3.42% | LUNA 3.30% | FTM 2.88% | HNT 1.89% | ADA 1.57% | MATIC 1.52% | INJ 1.11% | AR 0.96% | YGG 0.73% | LINK 0.72% | XDEFI 0.29%</span><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 96.73% | Meebit 3.27%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The uncertainty continues, but crypto seems to be holding strong, all things considered. What‚Äôs interesting is that BTC seems to be doing much better than the </span><a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjfzMrfysD2AhXI_rsIHW-SB2IQ3ecFegQIDBAc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or even the S&amp;P 500.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the fact that BTC has recently been highly correlated with stocks, there are significant crypto-specific headwinds that the crypto market continues to face.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, there‚Äôs the executive order that was looming over the crypto market </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/white-house-reportedly-preparing-executive-order-on-crypto"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When media outlets started talking about it again early last week, I expected to see a lot more volatility in the crypto market, specifically to the downside. However, the market remained relatively stable, and even pumped a bit when the Treasury Department </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/janet-yellen-let-slip-details-of-biden-s-executive-order-on-crypto"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accidentally published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a press release (more on that next).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, there‚Äôs Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and the concerns that cryptocurrency will be used to circumvent the sanctions levied on the Russian government. Although </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sanctions-on-russia-and-belarus-will-include-crypto-european-commission"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scrutiny in this area</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continues, the crypto market seems relatively unfazed, despite the fact that it could result in a regulatory crackdown in some jurisdictions.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there‚Äôs the news that regulators in the European Union are looking to apply the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/07/european-parliament-proposes-expanding-travel-rule-to-every-single-crypto-transaction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel rule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to every single crypto transaction. This would require everyone to report the counterparties in crypto transactions above a certain amount (in this case 1000 EUR) to authorities for tax purposes. This is eerily similar to provisions in the infrastructure bill, but markets didn‚Äôt budge.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a cherry on top, we had the SEC recently come out and </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-rejects-spot-bitcoin-etf-applications-from-nydig-and-global-x"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reject two more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spot Bitcoin ETF applications. This is significant because the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would have a direct effect on the price of BTC, unlike the Bitcoin futures ETFs we have now. Historically, SEC rejections of spot Bitcoin ETF applications have resulted in a dip, but not this time around.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This begs the question of why these events that were previously devastating to the crypto market are having next to no effect today. The most likely reason is that all the run-of-the-mill retail investors </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/94184/most-bitcoin-investors-bought-at-all-time-high-have-sold"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have already sold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so the FUD has next to no effect. There also hasn‚Äôt been that much interest in the crypto market in general, so these headlines aren‚Äôt getting much attention.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There‚Äôs another possibility however, and that‚Äôs that the crypto market is at a sort of crossroads because of the narrative around BTC. First BTC was seen as a risk-on asset correlated to the stock market. Then BTC was seen as an </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/10/08/bitcoin-not-gold-is-the-new-inflation-hedge-says-jp-morgan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inflation hedge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> similar to gold. Now we‚Äôre seeing the narrative of BTC as uncensorable money emerge. So which one is it? Or could it be all three?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess we‚Äôre about to find out‚Ä¶&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üßê </span><b>Executive Order üßê</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, we saw that long awaited Executive Order finally issued. This had many people on the edge of their seats about what could be included, especially in the context of what was happening at the time (Russian sanctions etc).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, thanks to an initial leak of a statement from the Treasury, we got a glimpse into the tone it would be taking. An Executive Order that would attempt to foster innovation in the space while maintaining investor protection.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it was finally issued the day after, many in the space (including me) not only breathed a sigh of relief but were also pleasantly surprised. That‚Äôs because the tone that was set the previous day by Yellen‚Äôs leaked press release was carried through with the Executive Order.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there were still concerns about crypto being used for illicit purposes without sufficient oversight, Biden did say the rise of cryptocurrencies was ‚Äúan opportunity to reinforce American leadership in the global financial system and at the technological frontier.‚Äù&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was quite a bit to cover in the EO, but here are some of the most important points:</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><b>No Bans or Regulations:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Contrary to the FUD, there were no bans or knee-jerk reactions to curtail crypto use and adoption. In fact, the EO was specific in that more research was required in order to better craft regulations. Regulations that could still foster innovation, as well as protect investors.&nbsp;</span></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><b>No new government bodies: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something else that was rumoured to be in the works was a specific agency that would craft crypto legislation. This does not appear to be the case. However, there was a directive for federal agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, the SEC and the CFTC to coordinate their efforts with respect to their oversight of the crypto industry.&nbsp;</span></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><b>R&amp;D on CBDCs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The EO did state that research on a US CBDC is encouraged with ‚Äúthe highest urgency‚Äù. This was on the back of the acknowledgement that over 100 other countries are already looking into CBDCs. More specifically, the EO will ask the Fed, as well as any other relevant agencies or departments within the federal government, to look at the possible risks of a CBDC, in addition to the possible benefits.</span></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, what is most important about this Executive Order for me is the fact that it shows how thinking has evolved within the administration. Biden has not been the most pro-crypto White House by any stretch of the imagination and the fact that even he now realises the importance of crypto innovation is telling.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Kristin Smith of the Blockchain association said in a </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/09/president-bidens-crypto-order-is-a-huge-step-forward-for-the-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this is a major milestone for the industry in the United States. Jerry Brito of CoinCenter </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1501583677112799232"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the EO shows that the Federal government recognises cryptocurrency as a ‚Äúlegitimate, serious, and important part of the economy and society, and I think it‚Äôs a good signal to serious people who‚Äôve been holding back from getting involved‚Äù.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs of course in no small part thanks to individuals like Kristin and Jerry and their organisations who have been standing up for the industry in Washington. From the big battles over the </span><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/122119/crypto-trade-associations-saw-lobbying-boom-amid-congressional-infrastructure-fight"><span style="font-weight: 400;">infrastructure bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provision last year, to this relatively positive Executive Order.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are of course also those pro-crypto politicians who have been standing up for the industry since last year. These include the likes of Tom Emmer, Pat Toomey and Cynthia Lummis, to name but a few.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this is a victory for the crypto industry, our work is not done. There are still anti-crypto zealots who seek to hinder our progress. There are still countries that have yet to appreciate the value that this technology brings. But, if we can make the case for crypto as well as the above have done in the US, then crypto really is unstoppable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b>üîê</b><b>Code is Law (sort of) </b><b>üîê</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday I was reading through the crypto news and I came across an </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/11/juno-prop-16-we-can-vote-away-your-money-for-free/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interesting article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by CoinDesk about a pending governance proposal on Juno, a smart contract-focused project in the Cosmos ecosystem. This governance proposal seeks to take cryptocurrency away from the largest JUNO holder. There‚Äôs a lot to unpack here, but let‚Äôs start by explaining how we got to this point.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most projects in the Cosmos ecosystem do an </span><a href="https://youtu.be/H5n8-2iVJNM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">airdrop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get their coins out. These airdrops typically go to ATOM holders, ATOM stakers, and/or liquidity providers on the Osmosis DEX. It‚Äôs believed that someone was able to game the airdrop process for JUNO using multiple wallets and got a whopping 3.1 million JUNO. For reference, they were supposed to get 50,000 JUNO.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the Juno community is pretty pissed off, and governance </span><a href="https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/16"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposal 16</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which concludes in 2 days and is currently passing) seeks to reduce ‚Äòthe gamer‚Äôs‚Äô JUNO holdings to 50k. The excess JUNO will be sent to the community pool. The rationale for doing this is not just out of fairness, but of security - the gamer holds a significant amount of voting and staking power.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The obvious concern here is that this will set a dangerous precedent for crypto projects with on-chain governance. Basically, it will send a signal that it‚Äôs okay for the community to come together and vote to take away someone else‚Äôs cryptocurrency (or worse). This is similar to the controversial </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/controversial-new-proposal-would-forgive-slashed-polkadot-validator"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polkadot proposa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">l from September 2020 to forgive a slashed Polkadot validator.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What‚Äôs funny is that the controversial Polkadot proposal ended up passing, yet we didn‚Äôt suddenly see every crypto with on-chain governance begin forgiving slashed validators via vote. As such, it‚Äôs unlikely that the Juno proposal will have any significant impact on how other ecosystems operate, and it probably won‚Äôt even set a precedent for Juno‚Äôs ecosystems.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the Juno proposal does do is reveal how careful this industry has to be with cryptocurrency governance. Given the circumstances of this situation, I reckon the Juno community made the right call. However, some would argue that crypto </span><a href="https://youtu.be/5_WGgiumARc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">code is law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All ‚Äòthe gamer‚Äô did was take advantage of what he/she would probably say was a poorly-designed airdrop mechanism.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This debate ultimately boils down to whether the end justifies the means or if the means justify the end. I‚Äôm no philosopher, but I‚Äôve lived long enough to know that the answer is a bit of both. Context matters a lot, but so does precedent. From where I‚Äôm standing, the dangerous precedent is not the action of taking away someone else‚Äôs crypto, but the ability to do so in the first place.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is significant because the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/zVxiFEzCp2U"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ESG crowd</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is obsessed with the governance component of cryptocurrency. How long before regulators demand that crypto communities vote to remove certain tokens, protocols, or even people from the blockchain itself? That‚Äôs the real risk I see here, and it seems to be a risk that the Bitcoin community has been aware of since the start.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I often get asked what‚Äôs the easiest way to buy crypto. My answer is almost always the Swissborg App </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/swissborg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swissborg App</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! That‚Äôs because not only is it the quickest way to get in and out of fiat, but it also has some of the best lending yields on the market.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over </span><b>16 fiat currencies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and British Pound are supported. Along with more exotic currencies like the Hungarian Forint, Isreali Shekel and more. That means you can easily get your hands on dozens of cryptos and whilst </span><b>avoiding pesky exchange rate fees.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that you can earn interest on those crypto assets, which gives you all that price exposure to the markets and access to</span><b> interest rates</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as high as </span><b>23.47%!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to give the Swissborg app a try? Well, you‚Äôll get up to</span><b> ‚Ç¨100 FREE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when you deposit more than ‚Ç¨50!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/swissborg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up to Swissborg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; get up to </span><b>‚Ç¨100 FREE!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîÆ</span><b> Video Pipeline</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üîÆ</span></p>

		<Title>Sanctions and Crypto: What This All Means!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few weeks, we‚Äôve seen horrific acts of aggression in Ukraine. In response, we‚Äôve seen some of the most stringent sanctions levelled on a country in recent history.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moves taken by countries in the West to punish Russian aggression are not only cratering the Russian economy, but also having global economic impacts on all of us.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs because they‚Äôre driving everything from high energy prices to food shortages and supply chain disruptions. It could also lead to an uncontained financial crisis or a collapse of confidence in the US dollar (yes, the dollar).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my latest video, I take a look at some of these potential unforeseen risks that could present themselves as the sanctions roll on. I also explain what this means for all financial markets - including crypto.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></p>
<p><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few small changes to the portfolio. Sold a bit of ETH &amp; DOT and have put this into UST which I will be holding as dry powder. I also added a bit of AR to my current stack (more on that below).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, as I disclosed in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1734"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I was airdropped some Apecoins on account of my portfolio of Mutant Ape NFTs. I am really excited about the potential of the BAYC ecosystem and will no doubt be hodling these (video update coming as well).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updated portfolio:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 29.28% | BTC 22.91% | SOL 8.19% | DOT 6.86% | ATOM 5.74% | RUNE 4.11% | APE 4.01% | UST 3.87% | LUNA 3.04% | FTM 2.71% | HNT 1.84% | AR 1.77% | ADA 1.53% | MATIC 1.43% | INJ 1.06% | LINK 0.71% | YGG 0.62% | XDEFI 0.32%</span></p>
<p><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 93.83% | Meebit 6.17%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre wondering why the crypto market is suddenly recovering, the answer seems to be Jerome Powell. On Wednesday he announced that the Federal Reserve would be </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/598450-fed-announces-interest-rate-hikes-to-combat-record-inflation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising interest rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the expected 0.25%. While the Fed‚Äôs tapering roadmap is fairly aggressive, the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/16/federal-reserve-meeting.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 rate hikes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it forecasts is significantly fewer than the 8-10 many market experts were expecting.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is good news because it means it‚Äôs still going to be relatively cheap to borrow for the foreseeable future, and that means we‚Äôre going to see more speculative investment into assets including crypto. As I mentioned </span><a href="https://youtu.be/QXkF22j5PKM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Jerome Powell‚Äôs testimonies, there‚Äôs even a possibility the Fed will resume money printing because of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a few macro factors on the crypto side that are pushing up prices as well. Even with the recent rally, the balances of both BTC and ETH on exchanges continue to drop like a rock. ETH </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-balance-on-crypto-exchanges-falls-to-lowest-levels-since-2018"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in particular</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is seeing a lot of accumulation, and that‚Äôs almost certainly because of </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/16/ethereum-merge-takes-place-on-kiln-testnet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the progress </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">being made on Ethereum‚Äôs transition from PoW to PoS which could occur sooner than expected.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as prices go, I randomly remembered something I read on Twitter, and that‚Äôs the theory that we‚Äôve been in an </span><a href="https://youtu.be/ltcnTTeDFjY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accumulation phase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the beginning of 2021. I know this sounds crazy, but just pull up the price chart of BTC on your favourite exchange, set it to weekly, and zoom out. What you‚Äôll see is a super long </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/horizontalchannel.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">horizontal channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between around 30k and 65k.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming this long term horizontal channel plays out, it could send BTC to anywhere between 90 to 140k. The craziest part about this is that the rally out of the pattern would be similar to what we saw in late 2020, meaning 4-6 months of bullish price action. I personally think this is fairly unlikely to occur, but if the Fed is forced to restart the money printer then it is very possible.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the most bullish metric of all is the general interest in cryptocurrency at the moment. If you look at </span><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=cryptocurrency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Search trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for cryptocurrency or any other social indicator, they‚Äôre all basically in the gutter. This is despite the fact that prices are, all things considered, looking pretty good at the moment. This means that we could see some serious rallies when retail interest returns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last thing about the market that‚Äôs caught my eye is how much South Korean crypto projects have been rallying lately. This seems to be because of the recent election of a </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/09/conservative-candidate-yoon-suk-yeol-wins-south-koreas-presidential-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pro-crypto president</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. This fine gentleman has promised to reverse many of the aggressive policies around crypto in the country, including zero tax on the first ~US$40,000 of crypto gains!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, I‚Äôm going to be keeping a close eye on any institutional crypto adoption because that seems to have fallen off the radar of many crypto holders. Recall that we‚Äôre still waiting for Elon Musk to announce that Tesla will be </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-likely-start-accepting-bitcoin-again.html#:~:text=Tesla%20and%20SpaceX%20CEO%20Elon,trend%20toward%20increasing%20that%20number."><span style="font-weight: 400;">accepting BTC again</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and there are many companies that are considering crypto payment integrations. Keep your eyes peeled for those white swans!¬†</span></p>
<p><b>üîê</b><b> Importance of Immutable Information</b><b>üîê</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned earlier, I‚Äôve added a bit more AR to my crypto portfolio. For those unfamiliar, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/jKFhHL1geVw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arweave</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a crypto project that makes it possible to store information in a decentralised manner ‚Äúforever.‚Äù This is primarily done using a mining mechanism that calculates the </span><a href="https://55mcexhgg4xql3l6xy4aoz2dzm23zghryqakakwtagj5djcm.arweave.net/71giX-OY-3LwXtfr44B2dDyzW8mPHEAKA-q0wGT0aRM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost of storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 200 years, and fees are gradually paid out to miners over that time to ensure they‚Äôre profitable.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arweave‚Äôs primary use case in crypto has been to store the massive blockchains of crypto projects, and it has been aggressively integrating with cryptocurrencies to store their transaction histories and NFTs. Most of these integrations have been happening via </span><a href="https://www.kyve.network/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyve Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the list includes Avalanche, Cosmos, Near Protocol, Mina Protocol and Solana.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of these integrations, Arweave has become the most used infrastructure project in Web3, at least according to the </span><a href="https://web3index.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web3 Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> put together by Livepeer. It should come as no surprise then that Arweave‚Äôs weekly transactions have been </span><a href="https://viewblock.io/arweave/stat/txCountHistory"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing exponentially</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the last year. It‚Äôs not just crypto projects that are leveraging Arweave either.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arweave has seen lots of usage from regular people who have been storing news headlines, images, and videos from Russia‚Äôs invasion of the Ukraine. The latest estimate I could find from late February suggests that Arweave has permanently stored </span><a href="https://arweave.news/arweave-ecosystem-weekly-report-26/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pieces of data relating to the conflict. Arweave has been used in similar contexts before, notably in Hong Kong </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/activists-archive-hong-kong-pro-democracy-newspaper-on-blockchain"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For context, Arweave was explicitly designed to prevent totalitarian forces of any kind from taking over. Arweave co-founder Sam Williams drew his inspiration from George Orwell‚Äôs dystopian novel </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1984</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so much so that the Arweave mainnet was launched on the same day as the book‚Äôs release (June 8th) and AR coins are denominated in Winstons (the main character in the book).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam believes that the best defence against totalitarianism is to create a decentralised and immutable record of events. This is again based on 1984, specifically the famous quote ‚ÄúWho controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past‚Äù. To that end, Sam wants to see </span><b>everything</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> archived on Arweave, be it ‚Äúfake news‚Äù or ‚Äú</span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/01/why-crypto-networks-should-preserve-russian-propaganda/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russian propaganda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äù.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could go on about why Arweave is amazing from this philosophical angle, but I‚Äôll sum it up with one of the many headlines that Arweave has referenced when making its case as a crypto project. In 2020, the United States National Archives (which are obviously supposed to archive data) were </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/01/why-crypto-networks-should-preserve-russian-propaganda/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caught modifying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an image they were storing. So yeah, Arweave is very necessary.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ü§î </span><b>Vitalik Has Some Concerns ü§î</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am sure that many of you have now seen the </span><a href="https://time.com/6158182/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-profile/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Vitalik in Time magazine. Unsurprisingly, the headline caught my attention: ‚ÄúThe Man Behind Ethereum is Worried About Crypto‚Äôs Future‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this title though, it was a really interesting interview and covered numerous topics. Everything from his upbringing, to background and interests. Of course, the parts that got everyone talking were the concerns raised by the man himself.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were fair concerns and I thought it only made sense to delve into them in a bit more detail.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the primary gripes that Vitalik seems to have with the crypto industry currently is the elevated levels of greed we see in the space. Indeed, nearly all of the talk about crypto is centred around the money people are making and less about the tech being built.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, this week we had the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/18/bored-ape-yacht-clubs-apecoin-surges-90-in-second-day-of-trading/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apecoin airdrop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which I mentioned above) as well as the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/16/ethereum-merge-takes-place-on-kiln-testnet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum merge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Kiln testnet.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which one do you think made the most headlines?¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course it was the former. Indeed, given that I was party to the airdrop, I covered it on my Twitter as well as my Telegram. However, the news about the Kiln Testnet merge seemed to have slipped past our news filters. That‚Äôs unfortunate because the implications of Ethereum‚Äôs transition to PoS are much more consequential than the value of the APE tokens.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not knocking Apecoin of course - as I‚Äôm going to be a long term hodler. But it just goes to show how difficult it can be to focus on the tech when so much magic internet money is being made.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, another gripe that he had was about the high transaction fees that we have been facing of late - especially on the Ethereum blockchain. While these are considerably below where they used to be in the past, they are still way too high for the network to be considered efficient enough to function as a realistic medium of exchange.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, there are those who will point to alternative layer 1 cryptocurrencies </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvaJDTC4ulo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with lower fees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, they usually come with a tradeoff of either decentralisation or security - that good old ‚ÄúBlockchain Trilemma‚Äù.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to these high fees on Ethereum, it appears to also revolve around the same concerns Vitalik has about those pursuits of gains. The bulk of the fees are being used in order to take part in NFT mints and earn mind-melting yields in DeFi lending protocols - essentially, use cases focused on making money.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is, of course, nothing wrong with monetary incentives in crypto. In fact, monetary incentives are what underlie the tokenomics that keep these networks functioning.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, I think that it‚Äôs important to not lose sight of what we are trying to achieve in the crypto space. It‚Äôs been on display for the world to see with the over </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/03/09/ukraine-has-received-close-to-100-million-in-crypto-donations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$100m in crypto donations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Ukraine has received over the past 4 weeks. I somehow think that this best illustrates how crypto can change the world - not someone who made 1,000x on their moonshot investment.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I do agree with Vitalik‚Äôs concerns about the ‚Äúimage‚Äù of crypto. However, we can help to shape that image by actively choosing what narrative we should focus on and what stories should be amplified.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here‚Äôs a question: How much do you spend on exchange fees? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer may surprise you. In fact, every single time you buy or sell a cryptocurrency on an exchange, you will have to pay them a fee or commission. These costs compound over the year and actually have a sizable impact on your returns over the long term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs why the more you save on trading fees, the more you retain long term.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, we have been able to get you guys a </span><b>trading fee discount</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over at </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/okx/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OKX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For those of you who have not heard of this exchange, they have been around since 2016 and are in fact, one of Asia‚Äôs most popular exchanges.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, they have recently made a big push into the Western Market with extensive fiat support, advanced trading platforms and deep liquidity in over 100 different altcoin pairs.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What‚Äôs my deal then?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, an exclusive </span><b>40% trading fee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> discount! Not only that, but this deal is </span><b>good for life</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, want to give OKX a try?</span></p>

		<Title>Could ETH Reach This?! Post Merge Prediction</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs closer than you think‚Ä¶&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Etheruem proof-of-stake merge has just passed a milestone with the final testnet before launch. This means that in a few months, we could see the network undergo its biggest upgrade ever!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has naturally led to quite a bit of excitement as people try to understand the implications for network efficiency, as well as deflationary tokenomics.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst this excitement however, there still remains a great deal of confusion over exactly what the merge will mean. From the perspective of the hodler, staker, miner and user.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also some wild price predictions out there, some of which are unrealistic and others more grounded in reality.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my video today, I take a deep dive back into Ethereum. I analyse what the merge means for all of us and what it could bring in the way of additional adoption from the institutions. I also dive into a recent financial model that tried to establish a ‚Äúfair‚Äù value for ETH post merge.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a href="https://cbtestw.kinsta.cloud/videos/ethereum-merge-incoming-eth-predictions-analysis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here.</span></a><a href="https://youtu.be/0GSDDjvwnDo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></a><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did some minor rebalancing in the portfolio this week. Took a bit of profit on APE, RUNE &amp; sold a bit of FTM. Going to shift some of this into ETH and the rest will be held in UST. After my research into the Ethereum video, I wanted a bit more exposure to it.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will keep you folks updated in </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my telegram channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with any other changes should they come through.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 30.60% | BTC 22.68% | SOL 8.32% | DOT 6.92% | ATOM 5.31% | UST 4.28% | RUNE 4.24% | APE 3.63% | LUNA 2.77% | FTM 1.89% | ADA 1.80% | AR 1.76% | HNT 1.70% | MATIC 1.42% | INJ 1.05% | LINK 0.70% | YGG 0.60% | XDEFI 0.34%</span><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 93.88% | Meebit 6.12%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling bullish yet? The fear and greed index for crypto says </span><a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not yet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Google Search trends for cryptocurrency are </span><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=cryptocurrency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the toilet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> too. Video views on the Coin Bureau YouTube channel aren‚Äôt looking too hot either, and we all know that‚Äôs the ultimate crypto market indicator. In all seriousness, plenty of signs are pointing to a bear market, so why is the crypto market pumping?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, we know that money is coming into the crypto market. That much is clear. Perhaps it's the institutions (see next section). But then again, institutions don‚Äôt typically buy crypto on the spot market, they buy OTC. Institutional accumulation is occurring though, because crypto balances on exchanges </span><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=distribution.BalanceExchangesRelative"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to drop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leaves a few possibilities. The first is Terra, specifically the Luna Foundation Guard. Tweets by Terra co-founder Do Kwon suggest the LFG is looking to accumulate as much as </span><a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2022/03/23/terra-luna-co-founder-reveals-purchase-for-3000000000-worth-of-bitcoin-btc-already-underway/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 billion </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">dollars of BTC, as reserves for Terra‚Äôs UST stablecoin. According to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1507158195470483456"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this Lunatic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Twitter, Terra already has 1.4 billion in stablecoins ready to go, and </span><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xad41bd1cf3fd753017ef5c0da8df31a3074ea1ea"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on-chain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signals suggest the buys have begun.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second possibility is El Salvador. As some of you may know, El Salvador is set to issue 1 billion dollars of Bitcoin bonds to fund the initial construction of Bitcoin City. Although reports initially suggested that the issuance of these ‚ÄòVolcano Bonds‚Äô would be delayed until the summer or the autumn, Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/president-bukele-hits-out-at-bitcoin-bond-fud-as-cz-jets-in"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently confirmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it‚Äôs all systems go.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third possibility is investors in the United Arab Emirates. If you‚Äôve been keeping up with my weekly </span><a href="https://youtu.be/u9rdTajaqaw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto reviews</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you‚Äôll know that FTX and Binance were the first and second exchanges to secure digital asset exchanges licences in Dubai two weeks ago. Global search trends for cryptocurrency show there‚Äôs lots of interest in the UAE, and that means someone is buying.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another place where search trends for crypto are up is Australia, and that‚Äôs because of </span><a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/australia-takes-next-step-towards-promised-overhaul-of-cryptocurrency-regulations/news-story/ce89e04fdb5c89670b5f6eaa2da863bf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the country is considering. What‚Äôs interesting is that one of these considerations involves requiring crypto exchanges to physically hold the crypto belonging to Australian users in Australia. This supposedly secure crypto custody could be incentivising investment.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final contributing factor could be regular retail investors who are ready to take on more risk. I suspect this because Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the S&amp;P 500 </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/95820/bitcoins-correlation-with-sp-500-reaches-17-month-high"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently hit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 1.5 year high. As some of you may know, the S&amp;P 500 is being propped up almost exclusively by speculative tech stocks like Tesla, which have </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-22/tesla-in-right-place-at-right-time-as-investors-look-past-risk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also rallied</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and are arguably in the same risk category as BTC.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As amazing as the recent pump has been, it looks like we‚Äôre still stuck in the ascending wedge / ascending triangle pattern for BTC on the daily. I have a feeling that we won‚Äôt see a truly convincing recovery until the Bitcoin Conference in Miami, where big announcements will almost surely be made. Be sure to take note of</span><a href="https://youtu.be/a5xNyAxwuPQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> big crypto conferences coming up this year including your very own </span><a href="https://cbtestw.kinsta.cloud/coin-bureau-cryptocurrency-conference-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coin Bureau Conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üè¢ </span><b>Institutions are Knocking üè¢</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 2 months, I have noticed a general easing of retail investor interest in cryptocurrencies. As prices have remained range-bound, impatient investors have decided to throw in the towel (or at least focus on other things).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, something else that I have noticed is the absolutely insane level of adoption taking place. Yes, this is a trend that has been present for over two years now but it has picked up to an ever more frenetic pace of late.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs dive into some of the most relevant examples which have happened in just the last two weeks:</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><b>Goldman Sachs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The firm </span><a href="https://blockworks.co/goldman-sachs-makes-milestone-crypto-trade-with-galaxy-digital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">completed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the first-of-its-kind OTC crypto transaction with Galaxy Digital. This was for a bitcoin non-deliverable option or NDO. The exact specifics of the trade are not known, but they are of less importance. What it does do is serve as a signal to other banks that they can be comfortable engaging in these kinds of trades. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the ‚Äúgolden standard‚Äù of bulge bracket investment banks has broken this ground, other TradeFi firms aren‚Äôt going to waste any time. I should also point out that GS had updated its </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1507066504063422474"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home-page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to showcase the investment case for crypto - talk about confidence!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">

</span></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><b>Bridgewater:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For those of you who have never heard of Bridgewater associates, it‚Äôs the largest hedge fund in the world. It is run by Ray Dalio who has become a legend in the Global Macro investing space. He has also not exactly been the biggest exponent of Bitcoin and crypto and has </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2020/01/21/billionaire-investor-sees-major-flaw-in-bitcoin-investment-thesis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the past said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it serves as neither a store of value, nor a medium of exchange. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, last year he mentioned that he </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/24/ray-dalio-i-have-some-bitcoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has personally invested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Bitcoin and just last week, Bridgewater </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/03/21/ray-dalios-bridgewater-investing-in-crypto-fund-sources/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disclosed that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it would be backing its first crypto fund. While it‚Äôs likely to be a relatively small investment made through an external vehicle, it‚Äôs still a major step for the hedge fund. It‚Äôs another ‚Äúsignalling‚Äù event which is likely to encourage other funds to make the move, lest they get left in the dust. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">

<li><b>BlackRock</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: From the largest hedge fund in the world to the largest asset manager, BlackRock is an absolute behemoth in the TradeFi space. The firm has been taking baby steps into the crypto space over the past year - something that I have talked </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/743"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about regularly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past. However, it‚Äôs the moves that the firm has made over the past week that have got everyone so excited. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-chairmans-letter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter to shareholders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO Larry Fink explained that BlackRock is seeing increasing interest in digital assets from its institutional clients. This is in sharp contrast to the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/14/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-seeing-very-little-demand-for-crypto-lately/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he made last year about there being ‚Äúvery little‚Äù client demand for crypto. While the investor note did not disclose exactly what BlackRock was doing to service these clients, there have been clues. As I pointed out in </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1587"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in February, BlackRock may be looking to integrate crypto into its Aladdin technology platform. If this is the case, it could lead to an explosion of crypto volume / liquidity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, his investor note also talked about the advantages of crypto in a world that has been rocked by the disruptions of the Russian invasion and the resulting sanctions. This is exactly the argument I made </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOjbqMdqZRU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last weekend about the financial implications of sanctions and how they could benefit crypto.&nbsp;</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are only three of the most high-level examples over the past week. However, there is a lot more TradeFi adoption taking place under the surface - perhaps the topic of an upcoming video.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But until then, you can take the above as a sign that the market is shifting into a new phase of extreme accumulation.&nbsp;</span><b>üí≤ </b><b>Crypto Tax Trends </b><b>üí≤</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you yawn, consider this. How countries tax crypto will have a significant impact on the crypto market in the short and medium term. With the massive gains that were made last year, countries around the world are changing their tax policies to take a cut of some of those gains. By the way, if you still need to do your crypto taxes, check out my</span><a href="https://youtu.be/ra9vgP9Mnj0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> top tax tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, as far as crypto taxes go, the country that‚Äôs been front and centre recently is India. Indian regulators have been wrestling with the crypto industry since </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/indian-parliament-s-agenda-for-winter-session-includes-bill-on-banning-private-cryptocurrencies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">late last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when a bill emerged that would see all privately issued cryptocurrencies banned. Indian regulators eventually softened their stance and </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cabinet-note-suggests-india-will-regulate-rather-than-ban-crypto"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eased off </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a total crypto ban, and now it‚Äôs clear why.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the Indian government passed a controversial </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-tax-policy-framework-passes-india-s-parliament-despite-pushback-from-lawmakers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto tax bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that contains some pretty crazy conditions. For starters, a 30% capital gains tax on all cryptocurrencies, including NFTs. Every initial purchase of crypto (i.e. fiat to crypto transaction) will also bear a 1% tax charge. As a cherry on top, no capital losses will be allowed, nor any crypto related expenses for companies.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">India‚Äôs crypto tax law is set to come into force on the 1st of April, and crypto holders and crypto companies are pretty pissed off. According to </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tntrkv/indian_government_is_literally_doing_your_profit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various posts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the r/cryptocurrency subreddit, Indian crypto holders are planning on cashing out on March 31st to take advantage of capital losses while they can. If true, expect to see some significant volatility in the crypto markets this week.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as crypto companies go, Indian crypto exchanges such as WazirX and Indian crypto projects like Polygon are warning that this crypto tax will lead to a </span><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/crypto-brain-drain-is-crazy-in-india-polygon-cofounder-sandeep-nailwal-says/articleshow/90140370.cms?from=mdr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brain drain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is basically when talented / intelligent / educated / experienced people in developing countries emigrate to countries with more favourable conditions, depriving their home countries of their skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a bigger deal than you think, because there are lots of Indians doing gig work in the crypto space, at least according to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyl9CoqKU8g"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polygon‚Äôs co-founders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under the recently passed law, the crypto income being earned by these individuals will also be taxed at 30%. This could lead to lots of people leaving the crypto industry, which is already short-staffed as it is; bad news for altcoins.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A similar situation is currently underway in the United States, specifically when it comes to how staking rewards are taxed. A Tezos staker named Josh Jarrett is </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/24/whats-at-stake-as-josh-jarrett-sues-the-irs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suing the IRS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over a tax refund he received on XTZ staking rewards, essentially demanding clarity over whether staking rewards are taxed when they‚Äôre received, or merely when they‚Äôre sold.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IRS has of course attempted to </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/03/us-tax-agency-moves-to-dismiss-lawsuit-by-tezos-stakers-who-refused-refund-demanded-trial/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismiss the lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but this has only brought more attention to the case. Now crypto lobbying firms like Coin Centre and the Proof of Stake Alliance are backing Josh, and this could give him the firepower he needs to force an answer from the IRS. Make no mistake, if this mission is successful, proof of stake cryptos will become very attractive.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This just goes to show how important it is to keep up with headlines related to crypto tax. As dry as they may be, they give you a glimpse into the future of the crypto market and industry. More importantly, they inform you where the most crypto friendly countries are as far as gains go. If you‚Äôre wondering which countries these are, look no further than </span><a href="https://youtu.be/omGrsqi7nrQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have always believed that the safest way to store the bulk of your crypto position is by holding it in a hardware wallet. That way you don‚Äôt run the risk of an exchange being hacked and losing all your funds.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, I use </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/trezor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as my crypto hardware wallet of choice.

		<Title>Could This REALLY Happen With Bitcoin?!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About a week ago, the IMF released a paper that looked at the ‚ÄúStealth Erosion‚Äù of dollar dominance as a reserve asset. It was a really fascinating read that explained how over the past few decades, the dollar has become less of a desirable asset to hold by central banks.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They explained how the rise of ‚Äúnon traditional‚Äù assets has led to a diversification of the dollar hegemony we have seen since the collapse of the gold standard in the 1970s.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why should this interest you? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the paper is being released at a time when faith in the security of dollar FX reserves is at an all-time low. And, as these large central banks start to shift to these non-traditional assets, there is a significant chance that they could diversify into digital assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is all covered in my video today. I break down the report and take you through some of the most illuminating data explaining exactly what this could mean for the dollar and Bitcoin‚Äôs eventual role in the new world order.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that here. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes to the portfolio this week. Pretty happy with the broader allocation. I am considering diversifying a bit more into additional layer 1 alternatives - but will keep you guys updated in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updated portfolio:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 30.61% | BTC 21.29% | SOL 10.27% | DOT 6.93% | ATOM 5.50% | RUNE 4.29% | UST 3.88% | LUNA 3.19% | APE 3.01% | FTM 1.97% | AR 1.76% | ADA 1.68% | HNT 1.57% | MATIC 1.34% | INJ 1.01% | LINK 0.70% | YGG 0.62% | XDEFI 0.37%</span><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 93.88% | Meebit 6.12%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week‚Äôs crypto market made me think about something that was said by Bob Loukas, one of </span><a href="https://youtu.be/LoWOO3GtUBY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my favourite</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crypto YouTubers. Bob basically said that as we approach the top of the current bull market, there will be unprecedented volatility; 10-20% or more to the upside and downside within days, sometimes hours. I reckon it‚Äôs quite possible we are entering this phase.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob isn‚Äôt the only reason I believe this either. I recently came across another incredible crypto related channel called </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GameofTrades"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Trades</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These guys have been doing some pretty hardcore research on both the stock market and the crypto market, and their thesis is that we could be entering something called a ‚Äòmarket melt-up‚Äô in both stocks and crypto.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/melt-up.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investopedia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a market melt-up is when assets rise purely because of speculation and not at all because of fundamentals. You could argue this has been the case for years, but what makes market melt-ups different is that they typically don‚Äôt have very much trading behind them, and they tend to happen during extremely uncertain times like we have now.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of timeline, we could potentially be looking at months of upside volatility which sounds crazy, but is actually consistent with historical trends. As pointed out by Game of Trades in </span><a href="https://youtu.be/l4sGOzcpV_I?t=429"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when the yield curve inverted in 2006 and 2018 (an indicator of a market crash), the markets had one last big rally before the ‚Äúreal‚Äù crash came in. Well, the yield curve </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/01/us-bonds-treasury-yields-invert-stoking-recession-fears.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just inverted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is of course no shortage of crypto-specific factors affecting the market. For starters there‚Äôs India, whose recently passed </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/30-crypto-tax-becomes-law-in-india-following-finance-bill-approval"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto tax law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> went into effect on April 1st. It‚Äôs believed that many Indian crypto investors sold just before midnight the day before so they could claim capital losses (since it‚Äôs not allowed under the new law), and bought back in the next day (looks like it!).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next there‚Äôs the European Union, which passed its own anti-crypto law on Thursday. As I mentioned in last week‚Äôs </span><a href="https://youtu.be/uqV3Ylz-8s4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this law requires cryptocurrency exchanges to collect detailed information about any crypto withdrawals to external wallets worth more than 1000 EUR (~1100 USD). Not surprisingly, this seems to have spooked the crypto market (for a day).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, we have Terra‚Äôs Luna Foundation Guard which has been aggressively accumulating BTC since the end of March. This buying pressure seems to have propped up the crypto market as a whole, and has led to an impressive rally for Terra‚Äôs LUNA. The LFG‚Äôs </span><a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1q9d4ywgfnd8h43da5tpcxcn6ajv590cg6d3tg6axemvljvt2k76zs50tv4q"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin wallet </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">now holds more than 1.4 billion dollars worth of BTC, and it‚Äôs only the beginning‚Ä¶&nbsp;</span><b>üí≤ </b><b>Terra‚Äôs Bitcoin Treasury </b><b>üí≤</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Terra‚Äôs Luna Foundation Guard first announced it had raised 1 billion dollars from various crypto VCs to create a Bitcoin treasury to back UST at the </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/luna-foundation-guard-raises-1b-to-form-ust-reserve-denominated-in-bitcoin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">end of February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I was honestly a bit sceptical. This is mainly because there weren‚Äôt many details about how it would work. Over the last week or so however, Terra founder Do Kwon has come out to explain.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, a bit of context. Terra brands itself as an ecosystem of decentralised stablecoins collateralised by LUNA, the largest and most popular of which is UST. Because 1 dollar‚Äôs worth of LUNA can always be burned to mint 1 UST and vice versa. This creates an incentive for arbitrate traders to maintain UST‚Äôs 1 dollar peg. More about Terra </span><a href="https://youtu.be/NiYUEBNvPPk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you want the details.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, Terra‚Äôs mint and burn mechanism works pretty well when the crypto market is going up. This is mainly because there‚Äôs lots of demand for leverage - in the form of stablecoins such as UST - when markets are rallying. Logically, the inverse is true when the crypto market is crashing. Arbitrage traders then cash out under pegged UST for LUNA, causing LUNA to crash even more.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Do explained in a </span><a href="https://youtu.be/NMRbP_b4JXM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Laura Shin, the risk of this so-called ‚Äòdeath spiral‚Äô is unfortunately ever-present with algorithmic stablecoins such as Terra‚Äôs UST. Do believes that this risk is preferable to the counterparty risk you get with centralised stablecoins (which can be frozen by their issuers) and I happen to agree, which is why I hold UST.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the purpose of the LFG‚Äôs Bitcoin treasury is to help prevent this death spiral from occurring. The reason why the LFG is using BTC is because it‚Äôs a neutral and trusted asset in the crypto industry. Having UST partially backed by BTC will increase trust in UST outside of Terra's ecosystem, and it will also help mitigate any manipulation of UST‚Äôs peg on other chains.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how will it work?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the LFG is planning to acquire another 1.5 billion dollars of BTC in the coming weeks. After that, the goal is to accumulate at least 10 billion dollars worth of BTC. In another r</span><a href="https://youtu.be/XARHjNn_4Ss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecent interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Blockworks, Do explained that this additional 10 billion dollars will be accumulated by directing a portion of Terra‚Äôs seigniorage fees for UST minting and burning towards buying BTC.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once 10 billion dollars of BTC has been accumulated, the LFG will put all that BTC into a smart contract and create a special decentralised exchange on Terra that will make it possible to mint 1 UST using 1 dollars worth of BTC and also claim 1 dollar‚Äôs worth of BTC by burning 1 UST. The exact mechanism is outside the scope of this newsletter, but you can learn more about it </span><a href="https://agora.terra.money/t/bitcoin-reserve-pool/5259"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This begs the question of what this all means for LUNA, but I reckon people are forgetting about what it could mean for BTC. As far as LUNA goes, it really depends on the design of the seigniorage mechanism which is being actively discussed in </span><a href="https://agora.terra.money/t/bring-back-seignorage-and-fund-yield-reserve-with-it/5641"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terra‚Äôs forum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the short term, it‚Äôs likely to have a negative effect on LUNA, especially since the LFG is selling LUNA to buy BTC.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the long term however, the increased confidence in UST should theoretically result in even more demand, and Do argues this increased demand will outweigh the decreased price effects caused by Terra‚Äôs seigniorage mechanism on LUNA (mainly burning LUNA out of circulation). It‚Äôs also important to note that Terra‚Äôs </span><a href="https://youtu.be/z54a-6hAogM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anchor Protocol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is starting to expand to other chains as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to BTC, LFG is explicitly looking for Terra to become the largest single wallet holder of BTC in the world. This will of course do wonders for UST, but it would potentially put the price of BTC at risk, especially if UST‚Äôs market cap ever enters the hundreds of billions. A run on the bank of that scale could cause some serious sell pressure, but I reckon BTC would recover.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è </span><b>$625m Hack. What‚Äôs Next ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, we had the largest hack in DeFi history take place. This was the Ronin SideChain bridge that saw $625m in ETH &amp; USDC exfiltrated. This was even larger than the </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/11/tech/crypto-hack/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poly Network hack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that took place last year.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has once again provided fodder for the Mainstream Media to point out the ‚Äúinherent risks‚Äù that come from cryptocurrencies. I can also see this being relayed in hearings on Capitol Hill as the usual anti-crypto zealots have their say.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I happen to think that this could be a long-term net positive for the crypto industry, and that comes down to a few factors which are likely to play out.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, it‚Äôs worth understanding exactly what this hack was.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a hack of a bridge between two blockchains (Ronin &amp; Ethereum). The hacker was able to get access to the private keys of 5 of the required keys out of the total 9 validators on the Ronin network. It was an exploit that took advantage of Ronin‚Äôs centralisation. Centralisation in both the way that they authorised transactions (the 5 threshold is really low) but also in who those validators were (4 of them were Sky Mavis validators).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What that essentially means is that once the attacker was able to breach the Sky Mavis systems, they got the keys to the kingdom (no pun intended). That‚Äôs because on top of the 4 Sky Mavis validators, they were also able to get access to the Axie DAO validator through the gas free RPC. I encourage you to read through </span><a href="https://roninblockchain.substack.com/p/community-alert-ronin-validators?s=r"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their disclosure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you want more info on how it happened.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, what this does show us is that despite the scalability benefits that come from more centralised blockchains, they do have these severe security risks. When you have a centralised network, there is more scope for attackers to gain control and manipulate it. And it‚Äôs worth noting that one of the first steps that Sky Mavis will embark on is setting validator thresholds at 8 instead of 5.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a long-term win for the virtues of decentralisation.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, this event is going to mean that a lot more scrutiny will be placed on cross-chain bridges. It‚Äôs been less than a month since we had that massive </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wormhole-token-bridge-loses-321m-in-largest-hack-so-far-in-2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wormhole bridge hack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that saw over $321m pilfered.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs worth noting that the risk of bridge exploits is something that Vitalik himself has talked about. Presciently, </span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a post on Reddit, Vitalik raised the alarm over the security of these bridges. So, if the warnings about the limits of these bridges were not enough to convince the community, a billion dollars in hacks will. In both cases, users will be made whole so the only losing parties are those who build the bridges.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a win for security because it means that developers will put a lot more care into the design of these bridges.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, what appears to be likely from this hack is the fact that the attacker is going to have a hard time hiding those funds or enjoying them. Given the power of blockchain tracking tools, those funds are more tainted than Russian oil in a North Korean tanker. Most of the funds remain in the hacker's wallet and any attempts to move them to a centralised exchange are blocked and immediately studied.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a high likelihood that either the hacker is caught, he abandons his loot or he decides to send it back. There is a reason that the Poly Network hacker </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/poly-network-hacker-returns-remaining-cryptocurrency.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decided to return</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all the funds that he stole last year.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what this shows is that despite the media perception of crypto hacks, hiding stolen cryptocurrency is near impossible. It will also deter other hackers in the future who might be considering such audacious thefts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it has been a while since my last merch drop.

		<Title>How Could They Do This?!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something that never ceases to amaze me is exactly how opaque, unstable and unfair traditional markets can be. We have seen this time and again from the mortgage meltdown, to the Gamestop saga and everything in between.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, last month we saw yet another financial scandal unfold. One that showed just how risky the traditional financial markets are and how they can unravel at a moment's notice.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the recent nickel short squeeze that almost paralysed the market. A crisis that saw the exchange on which nickel contracts trade not only shut down trading but also reverse an entire day‚Äôs buying and selling.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes the story even more crazy is who was on the other side of those trades. A billionaire and his banker backers who got rescued by the powers that be.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my video today, I am going to be doing a deep dive into this tawdry episode. I will be explaining exactly how this happened, who was involved, and what we can take from it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you want a bit of intrigue this Sunday afternoon, you can watch that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Took a bit of profit on SOL, DOT &amp; APE. Part of this was moved into LUNA and the rest is being hodled in UST. I remain bullish on LUNA in most part, given the demand for UST in staking &amp; other DeFi activities.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am also considering gaining additional exposure to some other L1 hedges. I have a keen eye on AVAX given the recent developments on Avalanche. I will keep you guys updated on this in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telegram channel.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 32.09% | BTC 22.03% | SOL 8.73% | UST 6.25% | DOT 5.97% | ATOM 5.13% | RUNE 3.82% | LUNA 2.98% | APE 2.15% | FTM 1.77% | AR 1.69% | ADA 1.68% | HNT 1.62% | MATIC 1.29% | INJ 1.16% | LINK 0.69% | YGG 0.54% | XDEFI 0.39%</span><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 96.15% | Meebit 3.85%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve lost count of the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/04/06/bitcoin-2022-miami-crypto-prices-plunge-bitcoin-defi.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweets and headlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that imply or even claim the Bitcoin Conference in Miami was a sell the news event. To be fair, it is a convincing idea on the surface. The crypto market crashed just before it kicked off, and the sell-off only accelerated as all the exciting announcements came out. I am not so convinced however, and here‚Äôs why.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the crypto market started crashing well before the event began, specifically on Tuesday. As it so happens, the stock market started crashing on Tuesday too, specifically at around 10 am EST. What happened at 10am EST on Tuesday? Federal Reserve governor </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/05/feds-brainard-sees-balance-sheet-reduction-soon-and-at-a-rapid-pace.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lael Brainard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said that the Fed will be reducing its balance sheet soon and ‚Äòat a rapid pace.'</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then came Wednesday, which was not a run-of-the-mill day. That‚Äôs because the Fed released the minutes (summary) of its March meeting, and they showed that it's not only looking to double the rate at which it will be increasing interest rates, but it‚Äôll </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/06/fed-minutes-march-2022-meetings-.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also be offloading</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up to 95 billion dollars from its balance sheet every month, starting in May.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many of you will know by now, raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, and it also makes any existing debt more expensive. This can cause a crash across the board, as overleveraged investors sell off assets to cover their increased debt burdens. Here‚Äôs the kicker: it‚Äôs not just the Fed that decides interest rates, but also the free market.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way this works is a bit </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/09/bond-market-interest-rates.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more complicated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but, as with most things in economics, it all has to do with supply and demand. If the demand for government bonds is low, then interest rates are high. If the demand for government bonds is high, then interest rates are low. Here‚Äôs another kicker: the Fed has also been one of the biggest drivers of demand for government bonds.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the pandemic, the Fed effectively </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doubled its balance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sheet from $4.5 trillion to $9 trillion. This consists mostly of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, of which it was purchasing tens of billions of dollars worth. So riddle me this: what happens when it starts selling off all these bonds? Logically, interest rates will rise even faster.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now for the biggest kicker of them all: this Tuesday the Bureau of Labour Statistics will be releasing the official inflation figures for March 2022 via the CPI (AKA the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/iJTUVPaNJ04"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CP Lie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). In case you haven‚Äôt noticed, the supply chain disruptions that are occurring as a result of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine has accelerated inflation, and most of this inflation happened in March.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, the markets are terrified that the inflation figure for March will be a shocker, and that this will cause the Fed to double down on its already hawkish stance. From where I‚Äôm standing, it looks like this is exactly what‚Äôs going to happen, but we won‚Äôt know for sure what the Fed is planning until its press conference </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/calendar.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in early May</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Expect lots of volatility until then‚Ä¶&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üå¥ </span><b>Initial Thoughts of Bitcoin Miami üå¥</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôm still digesting everything I saw and heard at Bitcoin 2022 in the Magic City, but there‚Äôs no question of what the highlight of the whole trip was for me. I will never forget how lovely it was to meet so many Coin Bureau fans who came up to say hello, say how much they enjoyed our work, and - of course - talk crypto. I lost count of how many of you I was lucky enough to meet, but it was a pleasure to chat with every single one of you. I knew of course that Coin Bureau had the best fans in the world, but it‚Äôs always nice to have one‚Äôs opinions confirmed!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference itself was a dizzying experience and, if you needed confirmation that Bitcoin is an unstoppable force for global good, then you certainly got it here. From talking with people who attended previous events, it was clear that Bitcoin 2022 was of a different order of magnitude: bigger, slicker and more ambitious than ever before.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I arrived at the conference on Thursday, which was the first day it was open to general admission ticket holders. Industry Day had happened the day before, yet it was impossible to miss the heavy corporate and institutional presence at the Convention Centre. As I wandered through the exhibition hall with two of my Bureau colleagues, we were struck by the staggering number of businesses leveraging both Bitcoin and the wider world of crypto. There were plenty of well-established brands on display, but they were outnumbered by the unfamiliar up-and-comers. The sector is growing exponentially.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was reflected in the roster of speakers and events taking place in the cavernous main hall and in smaller, more intimate spaces around the venue. If I have one regret from my two days here, it‚Äôs that I didn‚Äôt catch nearly as many of these as I would have liked. That said, there was so much going on, and so many awesome people to talk to, that it would have been impossible to see and do everything on my list.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first event I managed to catch was one of the best, a panel discussion hosted by David Zell under the banner of ‚ÄòOvercoming Inertia‚Äô with Allen Farrington, Glenn Greenwald, Dr. Jo Jorgenson and Andrew Yang. It would be hard to find four sharper, more astute people to listen to and Bitcoin is lucky to have them in its corner. Farrington is one of the best writers and thinkers in the space; Greenwald one of the most fearless defenders of civil liberties; while Jorgenson and Yang represent the best hope American politics has of breaking away from the moribund and partisan two-party hegemony it labours under.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All four were bullish on Bitcoin and what it could do for the world and for freedom, but weren‚Äôt afraid to sugarcoat our situation. ‚ÄòCBDCs are coming‚Äô warned Farrington, while Yang proved that he is a politician who doesn‚Äôt play to the gallery. When asked whether he would pardon Ross Ulbricht if elected president, he replied that presidential pardons were becoming tools for political gain and there were others more deserving of them. A brave answer, given the setting and the audience. If you‚Äôd like a more detailed breakdown of the conversation, you can check out Bitcoin‚Äôs Magazine‚Äôs coverage of it </span><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/andrew-yang-glenn-greenwald-share-philosophy-on-bitcoin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much has been written already about the speeches from Jack Mallers, Peter Thiel (gosh, that was a bit weird, wasn‚Äôt it?), Jordan Peterson, senator Cynthia Lummis, Mike Novogratz and others. I was lucky enough to catch several of them and I‚Äôll give you more of my thoughts over the coming week, as there isn‚Äôt room here to do them justice.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement of Strike‚Äôs integration with Shopify is yet more good news for mass adoption and, of course, we had progress on legal tender from the likes of Honduras and Madeira, as well as the news that Mexico is seriously discussing it. Let‚Äôs face it though, we were all hoping for something more sensational on that front, to measure up to last year‚Äôs news from El Salvador. We didn‚Äôt get it and the resultant disappointment seems to be partially reflected in the markets.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, I‚Äôm left feeling more optimistic than ever. Sure, it would have been great to have another whole nation state gobble down the orange pill, but remember that Bitcoin and crypto still face stiff resistance from the powers that be. The progress towards global adoption is not going to be smooth or quick.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, I‚Äôm heartened by the discussions I had with people around the conference. All over the world, hundreds of millions of people are starting to use crypto to free themselves from the constraints of the old financial system. In places like Pakistan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Latin America and countless others, adoption is gathering pace much faster than we think. This doesn‚Äôt generate the sort of headlines that send prices soaring, but believe me, we ain‚Äôt seen nothing yet.</span><b>üí≤ Bitcoin: Payments or a Portfolio? üí≤</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of Bitcoin Miami, there was something that came up in two of the talks that I found warranted a bit more thought. This is the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/gideonheilpern2/status/1512497874780581888?s=20&amp;t=oGGq7csRu5QWvWdXPwUV9w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Paradox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This paradox was best exemplified in the presentations of Zap Inc. founder Jack Mallers and Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor. The former pushed for BTC as currency, and the latter pushed for BTC as money.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confused? Allow me to explain.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currency is something that‚Äôs used as an actual currency, i.e. for everyday transactions. By contrast, money is typically the thing that backs the currency in circulation. As a </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092413/how-currency-works.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">simple example</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cash was once a currency that was backed by gold, which was the money. Today cash is still the currency, but there‚Äôs no money backing it (though some senile politicians would beg to differ).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin whitepaper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is titled ‚ÄòBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System‚Äô. If I told you today that BTC was digital cash, you would probably laugh. ‚ÄòDigital cash? No, digital gold!‚Äô is probably what you would say. If I asked you why, you‚Äôd probably explain that Bitcoin can‚Äôt scale to the point of becoming a global electronic cash system, but its monetary policy mirrors gold‚Äôs.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, you would say BTC isn‚Äôt a currency, it‚Äôs money.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is that there‚Äôs more to BTC than Bitcoin. In 2015, a pair of clever college kids came up with the Lightning Network, a layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin that can make BTC payments scalable enough for the entire planet (unironically). I won‚Äôt get into the Lightning Network here, but I seriously suggest checking out </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3cQNpOR_a0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video about it.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Easily one of the coolest L2s out there.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As some of you will know, the Lightning Network is what makes BTC as legal tender in El Salvador possible. The Lightning Network is also what makes Zap Inc.‚Äôs </span><a href="https://strike.me/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strike wallet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> possible, and Zap actually helped El Salvador set up it's Bitcoin infrastructure. Naturally, Zap Inc. CEO Jack Mallers has been all about getting people to spend BTC as currency via Lightning.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we accept the premise that BTC payments can safely scale globally via Lightning (which some people debate), then does that now make BTC a currency? If you asked Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor, he would say no. In fact, he would tell you to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZcFahsvFyI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">never part with your BTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under any circumstances ever, because it‚Äôs increasing in value over time; BTC is sound money like gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, which is it? Is BTC currency or is it money? If you ask me, it‚Äôs both, and this sounds like a paradox at first until you realise that the very idea of currency vs. money is the product of a financial era that‚Äôs slowly coming to an end. There are of course grand currency experiments like </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/we-re-already-buying-terra-founder-plans-to-obtain-10b-btc-for-reserves"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terra backing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> UST with BTC, but what about USD inflation? What happens when currency fails?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I don‚Äôt have the answer here, because we haven‚Äôt yet seen a global financial system where the currency is truly the money. This could simply be because past economies lacked the technologies to make this work, or it could be because this merging of currency and money doesn‚Äôt work due to deflation. One thing‚Äôs for sure though: BTC is damn valuable.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know it can be tempting to rock onto that crypto exchange, buy that crypto and just let it sit there. However, we know that nothing really beats the benefits of self custodying that crypto.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when it comes to self custody solutions, if you want to get the best security money can buy and treat your crypto like the million dollars it could one day be, then you‚Äôll want to get yourself a hardware wallet. I‚Äôve also talked about the top five hardware wallets in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t3Brlb0qzQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video here!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how do I personally store my crypto? Well, I use a </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/trezor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor hardware wallet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This device stores over 1,000 cryptos - so I imagine even the most enthusiastic altcoin dabbler will be able to store all their coins here.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîÆ </span><b>Video Pipeline</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üîÆ</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disruptions represent some of the biggest risks to the global economy right now. More specifically, disruptions to global supply chains.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has been an ongoing problem ever since the pandemic reared its head back in 2020. However, despite many countries seemingly putting it behind them, the hangover from covid-19 lingers on and has consequences for us all.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, things are likely to get a lot worse before they get better. There are external forces that keep buckling the global supply chain, from geopolitical conflict to zero covid policies. These are eventualities we should all be planning for.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, I will be taking you through the global supply chain crisis. I'll explain exactly how it happened and why it‚Äôs still getting worse. I'll also be breaking down what this means for the economy and what we should be doing about it.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/-5RPwo0dlek"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></a><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned last week, I was looking for a Layer 1 diversification investment. One of the most interesting projects that I have been following for sometime is Near Protocol. And, in research for an upcoming video, I have become really impressed with its tech, team and roadmap.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, as disclosed in </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1863"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my Telegram today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I have used some of the UST that I have been hodling to buy some NEAR. I think it‚Äôs an ideal time, given that it‚Äôs off its recent highs and has more upside potential than other layer 1s with higher market caps.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">No other changes apart from this. If there are any others I will update you in my official </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The updated portfolio is:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 32.21% | BTC 22.32% | SOL 8.65% | DOT 6.07% | ATOM 4.90% | UST 3.85% | RUNE 3.53% | NEAR 2.83% | LUNA 2.71% | APE 2.48% | FTM 1.73% | ADA 1.66% | AR 1.59% | HNT 1.57% | MATIC 1.31% | INJ 1.04% | LINK 0.70% | YGG 0.51% | XDEFI 0.34%</span><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 96.15% | Meebit 3.85%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you watched my </span><a href="https://youtu.be/ANztXh1gOG0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the upcoming Coin Bureau conference, you‚Äôll know that one of the other crypto YouTubers who will be in attendance is Maren Altman. For those who don‚Äôt know, Maren is a crypto trader who uses astrology as part of her technical analysis. I know it sounds crazy (and I honestly thought it was for a while) but it seems to be somewhat accurate.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great example here is Maren‚Äôs </span><a href="https://twitter.com/marenaltman/status/1352832431318052864?s=20&amp;t=qr_YImKNS3RqIEfvYKf8-w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pinned tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from January 2021. Basically, she predicted that there would be a big move in the crypto market in mid May, and another in mid-late July. Lo and behold, the crypto market crashed in mid-May because of China‚Äôs crypto mining crackdown, and the crypto market recovered after Jack Dorsey‚Äôs corporate Bitcoin event in mid-late July.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As is often the case with these kind of phenomena, there‚Äôs a logical explanation. Most of Maren‚Äôs astronomical analysis revolves around the phases of the moon, with a full moon seemingly preceding a short-term BTC rally. As it so happens, there‚Äôs macro stuff that happens on a monthly and bi-weekly basis which moves the market, such as Bitcoin </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-bulls-need-to-reclaim-41k-ahead-of-friday-s-615m-btc-options-expiry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">options expiries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, what Maren is ultimately doing is indirectly tracking other market trends with her astrological charts, and she posted </span><a href="https://twitter.com/marenaltman/status/1515060083226460160?s=20&amp;t=qr_YImKNS3RqIEfvYKf8-w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an updated one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the weekend. With a full moon having happened last night, Maren is predicting a short term rally in the crypto market that will end sometime in early May because that‚Äôs when the eclipse season will be (obviously!).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you might have guessed, there‚Äôs something else happening in early May that could move the markets, and that‚Äôs the Federal Reserve‚Äôs </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/calendar.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">press conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where it will detail how it plans on proceeding, as far as interest rates go. The market has priced in another 0.5% rate hike, so if we see anything higher, there will probably be a crash, and if it‚Äôs lower, the rally could continue.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the Fed is just one of many factors that could cause the crypto market to tank next month. Regulators seem to have kicked into high gear, particularly the SEC, which is now looking to </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coin-center-takes-aim-at-unconstitutional-sec-redefinition-of-an-exchange"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redefine the term</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äòexchange‚Äô in what appears to be an explicit attempt to bring decentralised finance under its control.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, there are lots of folks who are fighting for crypto in US congress such as senators Pat Toomey and Cynthia Lummis. The former recently </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/toomey-drafts-bill-to-exempt-stablecoins-from-securities-regulations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tabled a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make sure the SEC doesn‚Äôt crack down on stablecoins, and the latter is working on a </span><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/senator-lummis-details-new-bitcoin-bill"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bipartisan bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to protect the entire crypto industry in the United States. Cynthia‚Äôs bill includes privacy protection, which brings me to the next section‚Ä¶&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üëÅ </span><b>The War on Privacy</b><b>üëÅ</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you follow me on Twitter then you probably </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1515298552246935552?s=20&amp;t=9ayI4S4ETEb0oatt0kErUw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw my post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how Tornado Cash has teamed up with Chainalysis to prevent sanctioned wallet addresses from interacting with the protocol. For context, Tornado Cash is an Ethereum protocol that makes it possible to cut the connection between sender and receiver. I actually covered Tornado in depth </span><a href="https://youtu.be/9eOHeLSp7lg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last February.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Tornado Cash and other privacy preserving protocols are often used by criminals to launder money, a </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/only-8-of-mixed-crypto-coins-tied-to-illicit-activity-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Chainalysis itself found that only about 8% of mixed cryptocurrency is tied to illicit activity. This means that the overwhelming majority of people who use these protocols are just trying to preserve their privacy on a public blockchain.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs believed that the Tornado Cash caved in to authorities because the hacker of Axie Infinity‚Äôs Ronin is believed to be part of the infamous North Korean hacking group, </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/north-korean-lazarus-group-allegedly-behind-ronin-bridge-hack"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lazarus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Naturally, the Ronin hacker was using Tornado Cash to cover their tracks, and it looks like the hacker of Solana‚Äôs Wormhole bridge tried doing the same </span><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/wormhole-hack-february-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this is part of a much larger trend of cracking down on privacy-preserving crypto technologies that seems to have accelerated in recent months. Two other announcements that come to mind here are </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-crypto-for-criminals-coinjoin-btc-mixing-tool-to-block-illicit-transactions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wasabi‚Äôs announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it would be blocking illicit BTC transactions, and </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/trezor-removes-controversial-address-verification-protocol-other-wallets-follow-suit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor‚Äôs attempt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to introduce a KYC compliance tool for its hardware wallet.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, crypto traders have apparently been having </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/qvuw99/halted_monero_withdrawals_on_binance/https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/qvuw99/halted_monero_withdrawals_on_binance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a hard time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrawing Monero‚Äôs XMR from centralised exchanges for months. Some XMR holders are speculating that exchanges are lying about how much XMR they actually have (which they can do thanks to the privacy of Monero‚Äôs ledger). To find out, some XMR holders will be staging a ‚Äò</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u3jozd/the_monerun/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monerun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äô tomorrow.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it‚Äôs likely that the XMR withdrawal issues are in fact due to liquidity issues, it‚Äôs almost equally likely that exchanges are under extreme scrutiny when it comes to privacy coins. Case in point, Bittrex </span><a href="https://havenprotocol.org/knowledge/withdrawing-from-bittrex/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently delisted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Haven Protocol, a fork of Monero that makes it possible to create a private synthetic stablecoin similar to Terra‚Äôs UST. You can learn more about it </span><a href="https://cbtestw.kinsta.cloud/review/haven-protocol-xhv/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, here‚Äôs where things get interesting. Despite this apparent crackdown on privacy, institutional investors are investing hundreds of millions of dollars into privacy preserving protocols. </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/02/07/aleo-blockchain-raises-200m-for-privacy-minded-defi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aleo Blockchain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/secret-network-raises-400m-establish-170728875.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secret Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are two of the most obvious examples. Heck, even Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert </span><a href="https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/1494360617880371200?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is advising people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to acquire privacy coins.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What this suggests is that there is a middle ground to this relentless attack on privacy in crypto, and it makes sense. Institutions don‚Äôt want you to know how much crypto they hold, and they can‚Äôt make themselves private on a crypto blockchain without giving regular folks the same ability. That would be too much of a double standard for investors to swallow, or would it‚Ä¶?</span><b>ü§µ&nbsp; Accredited Investors Win Again ü§µ</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, there was another blow for retail crypto investors in the United States and it came from Celsius. More specifically, the crypto lending platform disclosed that it would be </span><a href="https://blog.celsius.network/important-celsius-update-to-our-us-clients-6df471420cc7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">making changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its ‚Äúearn‚Äù product and only leaving it open to accredited investors.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who don‚Äôt know, an accredited investor is an individual or institution that is allowed to trade securities that may not be registered with the financial authorities. When it comes to defining an individual accredited investor, it‚Äôs anyone who has an annual income of over $200k or has a net worth of over $1m (i.e: rich folk).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What this means is that only those people who meet the definition of an accredited investor are allowed to invest in assets that could be considered unregistered securities. These include many of the tokens that have been issued by cryptocurrency projects. It‚Äôs also why startups are only allowed to raise money from these types of investors and not the retail type.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ok, but what does this have to do with crypto interest accounts?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that‚Äôs because according to the regulator's read of the securities laws, these crypto interest bearing accounts could be seen as akin to unsecured loans. These are of course unregistered securities and hence they cannot be offered to retail investors.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is something that BlockFi recently discovered in its </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-26"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$100m settlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the SEC earlier this year. It is also something Coinbase </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/20/coinbase-drops-planned-lend-program-after-sec-warning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">came up against</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year as it was about to launch its ‚Äúlend‚Äù program. Celsius is having ‚Äúongoing discussions‚Äù with regulators and one can only assume that this action was taken preemptively.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, according to the letter of the law, these lending products are in breach. But, is it fair? Is it fair that investors who have less income or wealth are automatically assumed to be less ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù and hence unable to make prudent investment decisions?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, there could be occasions in which investors should be protected from these unregistered offerings. But is a crypto interest account paying 5-7% p.a. the biggest risk that they face? Shouldn‚Äôt the regulators </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1514215948068306947"><span style="font-weight: 400;">be focusing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on some of the most common forms of crypto fraud that are taking advantage of retail traders on a daily basis?&nbsp; Why are known celebrity shills allowed to constantly take advantage of their followers with scammy NFTs and tokens and face no scrutiny?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs hard to square the circle between the statements of ‚Äúinvestor protection‚Äù and what we see taking place in the crypto space.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what this does mean is that if you are a US citizen who doesn't happen to have the means to be defined as ‚Äúaccredited‚Äù, it means that you will have to make do with standard fiat interest-bearing accounts. With these, you would be lucky to be getting 0.5% p.a. Of course, with inflation now running at 8.5%, it means your real effective savings rate is -8%.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs really effective ‚Äúinvestor protection‚Äù...</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span><b> Deal of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know that NFTs have been through excessive periods of hype. However, if there is one NFT asset that I think still has potential is blockchain domains.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is because, unlike most overvalued collectible NFTs, these have large amounts of additional utility value. They can be used as a means to send and receive payments in a personalised crypto address. It‚Äôs a lot easier to tell someone to send crypto to ‚Äúcoinbureau.crypto‚Äù than to bandy about a long form address.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of this, these also have a ‚Äúflex factor‚Äù to them. Much like other NFT collections, they are unique and hence they have a lot more value. There are some pretty high value NFT blockchain domains already.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who have been around for some time, you will remember the massive returns that were made from some of those early .com domains.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun fact: Micheal Saylor‚Äôs microstrategy made </span><a href="https://domainnamewire.com/2020/09/17/how-microstrategy-got-its-domains-and-sold-voice-com-for-30-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quite a killing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the domaining space with one of their most recent sales of voice.com netting in $30 million.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, there is definitely potential in domain names from a practical and historical standpoint. And, if you are looking to get your hands on your very own blockchain domain, then there is one place.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over at </span><a href="https://guy.coinbureau.com/unstoppable-domains/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unstoppable Domains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can get access to </span><b>ten unique domain extensions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like .crypto, .coin, .wallet and more.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been able to secure you guys an exclusive deal.

However, we know that we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to give all this additional value to our attendees were it not for our event sponsors.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I wanted to give a big shoutout to all the sponsors for supporting this exciting event and helping make it all possible.&nbsp;</span></p>

		<Title>This Company Controls Everything!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a company out there that has more funds running through its systems than the entire GDP of the USA. A company that can and has used its clout to effect ‚Äúsocietal change‚Äù. A company that has a line into the most powerful politicians in the world.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs a company that has recently come front and centre as it has started exploring investments in the crypto space.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am of course talking about BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world. While some may have heard of it before, it can be hard to appreciate just how much control it has over the financial markets. Control that is afforded to it through leveraging </span><b>our money</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my video today, I am going to be taking a deep dive into this company and explaining exactly why it has so much power - not only with the money it has to invest, but with the edge it has over other asset managers. I will also be showing you when it has exerted this power and how it plans to continue doing so in the future.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/qs_mWvf6yRI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></a></p>
<p><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No big changes to the portfolio this week. Took a bit of profit on APE and SOL and will be keeping this in UST. It seems to be a pretty volatile week coming up (see below) so I am keen to have some dry powder in stablecoins before then.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will keep you regularly updated with these moves in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 31.59% | BTC 22.22% | SOL 8.08% | DOT 6.17% | UST 4.73% | ATOM 4.71% | RUNE 3.59% | APE 3.18% | LUNA 3.07% | NEAR 2.91% | FTM 1.65% | ADA 1.57% | AR 1.50% | HNT 1.35% | MATIC 1.31% | INJ 0.93% | LINK 0.65% | YGG 0.45% | XDEFI 0.33%</span></p>
<p><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 95.79% | Meebit 4.21%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me start by saying that last week was a wild ride. If you watched last week‚Äôs </span><a href="https://youtu.be/eF_8ifBlwaw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you‚Äôll know I spotted a bearish pennant on BTC‚Äôs daily price action and predicted that its price would either drop to around 38k or pump to around 42k. Well, BTC somehow managed to hit both price targets - it dropped to 38.5k and then spiked to almost 43k days later!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we all know that crypto is volatile, but last week surprised even me. As far as I can tell, it has mostly to do with the balance of BTC on exchanges which continues to </span><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=distribution.BalanceExchangesRelative"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drop like a rock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and is now the lowest it's been in over 4 years. This means it doesn‚Äôt take much money to move the market as it did even just a few weeks ago, and this effect is only increasing.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing I wasn‚Äôt expecting was the sudden dip late last week. I‚Äôm still trying to figure out what caused it, and the obvious answer seems to be the Fed. Chairman Jerome Powell made some more </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/21/powell-says-taming-inflation-absolutely-essential-and-50-basis-point-hike-on-the-table-for-may.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hawkish comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Thursday that caused the crypto market and stock market to tumble. The odd thing is that the markets had </span><a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already priced in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what he said about rate hikes.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A contributing factor might have also been Earth Day. This is because many people still think that Bitcoin mining is killing the planet, and I suppose you can thank the mainstream media for that one. As explained in </span><a href="https://youtu.be/UCwLIE62iWg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Coinshares‚Äô crypto mining report, Bitcoin mining operations only use 0.05% of the world‚Äôs energy, and account for 0.08% of global carbon emissions.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, these facts seem to have fallen on deaf ears, particularly in the European Union where some politicians seem to be </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/21/sweden-eu-discussed-bitcoin-proof-of-work-ban-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intent on killing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crypto mining at all costs. Many altcoins have also capitalised on this fake news to promote themselves as the ‚Äòenvironmentally friendly‚Äô alternative to Bitcoin. Too bad nobody is </span><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=cryptocurrency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paying attention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I digress.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also suspect that the </span><a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.calendar.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">options expiries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Bitcoin this upcoming Friday might be weighing down on the crypto market. As I‚Äôve mentioned before, options expiries tend to increase volatility as market makers adjust their hedges. This is why BTC tends to drop in the second half of each month, at least according to expert crypto traders like Bob Loukas, who is also one of </span><a href="https://youtu.be/LoWOO3GtUBY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my favourite</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crypto YouTubers.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite all this apparently downward pressure however, it sounds like the institutions are still buying‚Ä¶¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üëÅ </span><b>Insider Information About Institutions In Crypto</b> <b>üëÅ</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every so often we‚Äôll get an email from a fan offering to give us insider information. Oftentimes these are just attempts to get us to look into ‚Äúhidden gem‚Äù crypto projects. However, this was not the case with a fan who reached out last week. This fan (who I will call Jerome) works for a crypto exchange and can see what the institutional investors are up to.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here‚Äôs what he said‚Ä¶¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, there‚Äôs been a decline in institutional trading volume for cryptocurrency, which is consistent with headlines like </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/19/crypto-funds-see-outflows-as-bitcoin-gets-more-interest-rate-sensitive/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Interestingly though, the number of institutions dabbling in cryptocurrency continues to increase, despite this decrease in trading volume. In other words, new institutional investors are coming in, and are just waiting for the right time to buy.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As some of you will know, when institutions are looking to execute large block orders, they will do the trade OTC (Over the Counter). This is mainly to make sure they don‚Äôt move the market with their trades. Jerome said that OTC trading volume by institutions seems to be about the same as the spot trading volume, and that when you see a huge </span><a href="https://youtu.be/XSJnX9oe_is"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flow of funds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to or from an exchange without prices being affected, that‚Äôs OTC.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that‚Äôs interested us lately is all the apparent interest in altcoins that‚Äôs coming from institutions, as revealed by headlines like </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/96722/cme-group-looking-at-offering-solana-cardano-futures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Jerome confirmed that institutions are very interested in altcoins, and sometimes they‚Äôre even investing in very small cap altcoins. He also said it‚Äôs not clear whether this small cap buying is for speculation or serious investment.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suppose this explains Coinbase‚Äôs </span><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/increasing-transparency-for-new-asset-listings-on-coinbase-e06f2edb095e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">peculiar picks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for upcoming listings?¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyways, the most surprising thing Jerome said was that exchanges make a conscious effort not to track which entities are moving the market the most. This is simply because if that information was to ever get leaked, then it could make for very bad press or even accusations of market manipulation - which </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/04/tether-bitfinex-file-motion-to-dismiss-market-manipulation-lawsuit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some crypto exchanges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been accused of in the past.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ties into the importance of the crypto reports I frequently cover. Jerome said that these reports are treated ‚Äúlike gold‚Äù among exchanges and institutional investors, and this is basically because exchanges and institutions don‚Äôt actually know what their counterparts are doing. Jerome specified Messari‚Äôs crypto report as being particularly important, so </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXp32pWkwqI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">check it out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last insight Jerome was able to provide was that he‚Äôs starting to see institutions from different jurisdictions invest in crypto. Although he couldn‚Äôt tell us where because of confidentiality agreements, I suspect one of the regions of interest is the Middle East, specifically commercial hubs like Dubai, which have been issuing lots of </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/it-s-official-binance-secures-a-license-to-operate-in-dubai"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto licences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lately.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs safe to say that Jerome‚Äôs insights were incredibly valuable, and if you happen to have any insider information of your own, feel free to contact us via the </span><a href="https://cbtestw.kinsta.cloud/contact/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Coin Bureau website (scroll down to the bottom). We would love to hear your thoughts, especially when it comes to information that could improve the quality of our content. Thanks again to Jerome for his!¬†</span></p>
<p><b>üìà¬† The Script is Flipped üìà</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin is a tech stock‚Ä¶¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that‚Äôs at least if you believe some of the latest correlation statistics that the folks over at Arcane Research have compiled. In their most recent report, they </span><a href="https://prnt.sc/Hw4F84TlDEhe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Bitcoin‚Äôs 30 day correlation with the Nasdaq </span><b>is at 70%!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is perhaps the strongest correlation that Bitcoin has had with the index yet. Moreover, a 70% correlation is generally considered to be a ‚Äústrong statistical relationship‚Äù.¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of this, the report also found that Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with gold is at its lowest level ever at -45%. This is also statistically significant and shows that Bitcoin has been moving in an opposite direction to gold over the past few months.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what does this tell us?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, based on the past few months of price performance, Bitcoin is exhibiting returns similar to that of a high risk tech stock and less like a safe haven asset. This seems to run contrary to the well-established narrative of Bitcoin as an attractive hedge for market contagion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, some people will say that past performance is not indicative of future returns - and that is indeed true. However, these statistical relationships between different asset classes are used as inputs in advanced algorithmic trading models. Hedge funds and other institutions use these relationships in order to drive decisions on their Bitcoin trading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is a collapse in the Nasdaq on a particular day, then these algorithms react and proactively sell Bitcoin (vice versa for a rally). What this leads to is a self-fulfilling prophecy where current market movements are driven by assumptions around historical relationships.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These reinforcing market mechanisms make it hard for Bitcoin to decouple from stock market movements. Therefore, we are likely to see this strong relationship between the two asset classes continue playing out for the next few months. So, if you are looking for an asset that could hedge your short term equity market risk, then Bitcoin may not be it.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key word there is of course </span><b><i>short term</i></b><b>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historical relationships don‚Äôt hold forever and the BTC / Nasdaq correlation has been negative in the past. I do believe that it will once again decouple and as the correlation approaches 0, it will have less of an ancillary impact on algorithmic trading decisions.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, timing this is hard. But I am firmly of the view that we will see a decoupling towards the end of the year. I also expect to see Bitcoin‚Äôs negative correlation with gold become less statistically significant over the same time period.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, </span><a href="https://store.coinbureau.com/product/keep-calm-black-t-shirt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keep calm and hodl on.¬†</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you make the most out of markets that trade 24/7/365?¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, sometimes those unique buying / selling opportunities come at us when we least expect it. Moreover, we can‚Äôt be expected to have our trading accounts open and primed with every waking hour.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, is there another way to still monitor these markets without being glued to our screens?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There definitely is, and that‚Äôs with automated trading strategies. Pre-programmed algorithms that will buy or sell assets based on unique criteria that you have for it.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know that may sound complicated, but nowadays, there are tools that allow you to develop those strategies with no coding experience at all.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that sounds like something you want to learn more about then you probably want to watch my video on the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hv0BQwYlPw&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best crypto trading bots.¬†</span></a></p>

		<Title>The IMF Wants To Control Crypto! Here‚Äôs Why!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs no secret that the IMF is not a fan of cryptocurrency‚Ä¶&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heck, it even threatened to withhold financing to El Salvador because of its Bitcoin legal tender bill and pressured Argentina to drop its crypto ambitions.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the IMF recently released its global financial stability report and it was an incredibly in-depth study. It went over some of the biggest risks facing the world today - most of which relate to the ongoing Ukraine conflict and subsequent sanctions.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the IMF couldn‚Äôt do a report on financial ‚Äúrisks‚Äù without diving into crypto. While some may want to dismiss these risks on account of where they're coming from, that would be imprudent.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs because there are some genuine concerns highlighted and it‚Äôs important for us not to be like the anti-crypto zealots we rail against.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in my video today, I break down this report and take a look at the most important sections. I analyse whether there are any merits to the IMF's concerns and what they could mean for the crypto markets.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that</span><a href="https://youtu.be/5zo7oXDeCxI"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Took a bit more profit on my APE &amp; closed out of my YGG. I will be holding this in UST as dry powder. Although there appears to be some attractively priced cryptocurrencies, I think we are due for a pretty rough week.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I make any portfolio changes, I will update all of you in my official</span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 33.02% | BTC 23.72% | SOL 7.81% | UST 6.66% | DOT 5.52% | ATOM 4.11% | RUNE 3.06% | LUNA 3.02% | APE 2.66% | NEAR 2.38% | ADA 1.52% | AR 1.42% | FTM 1.17% | MATIC 1.16% | HNT 1.13% | INJ 0.77% | LINK 0.60% | XDEFI 0.27%</span><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 95.53% | Meebit 4.47%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôll give it to you straight: the crypto market isn‚Äôt looking too good at the moment, and though we‚Äôre not in a bear market yet (still higher lows on BTC), we‚Äôre fast approaching this possibility. This is simply because of the unholy combination of macro factors that‚Äôs crushing just about every asset market out there: lockdowns, supply chains, war, inflation, and now</span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3464102-stocks-stink-as-inflation-recession-fears-rattle-wall-street/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recession fears</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are also anxiously waiting to see what the Federal Reserve will do in response to all of this news when it holds its press conference this Wednesday. If you believe the CME‚Äôs FedWatch Tool, it looks like the market</span><a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">currently expects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Fed to increase interest rates between 0.75-1%. If you believe consensus </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-29/powell-seen-slowing-rate-hikes-after-may-and-june-front-loading"><span style="font-weight: 400;">economist estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Either way, it‚Äôs safe to say that it‚Äôs anyone's guess, and uncertainty = bad.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make things worse, there are also a bunch of crypto-specific factors dragging down the crypto markets. The most important one was arguably the delay of</span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/failure-to-launch-australia-s-first-3-crypto-etfs-all-miss-launch-day"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">all three</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crypto ETFs that were supposed to list on Australian stock exchanges last week. Had those listings happened, it could have resulted in lots of buying pressure for BTC and ETH, given that they‚Äôre all spot ETFs.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, we have seen some developments which could be very good for the crypto market in the long term. The most important example here is Fidelity, which will allow clients to invest in Bitcoin from their 401k retirement accounts. With a 20% maximum allocation, this means BTC could see up to</span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2022/04/29/historic-milestone-bitcoin-is-poised-for-800-billion-buying-frenzy-as-ethereum-bnb-xrp-solana-cardano-and-dogecoin-prices-plateau/?sh=2ee859244d20"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 800 billion dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of inflows this summer when the offering goes live.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We‚Äôre also seeing countries make significant steps towards adopting cryptocurrency on a national scale. The first is Panama, which recently signed a</span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/28/panamas-crypto-law-no-legal-tender-but-digital-assets-exempt-from-capital-gain-tax/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that brings regulatory clarity to the industry, as well as zero taxes on capital gains. Brazil is coming close to passing a similar</span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazil-s-senate-approves-bitcoin-law-to-regulate-cryptocurrencies"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the Central African Republic has</span><a href="https://decrypt.co/99071/central-african-republic-share-bitcoin-adoption-plans-central-bank-report"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made Bitcoin legal tender.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that wasn‚Äôt crazy enough, the Swiss National Bank</span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/29/swiss-national-bank-owns-no-bitcoin-but-could-buy-in-the-future-chair-says/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recently remarked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it might add BTC to its balance sheet in the future, though BTC currently doesn‚Äôt meet the bank's standards of a reserve currency. If you watched</span><a href="https://youtu.be/QcXIwytY5qM"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the decline of the US dollar, you‚Äôll know this is something I predicted. If you ask me, it‚Äôs not a question of if, but when central banks buy BTC.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As amazing as all of this is, there‚Äôs another crypto specific factor that‚Äôs increasingly coming to the fore, and that‚Äôs the rapid rise of central bank digital currencies. In the last week alone, the</span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-philippines-will-launch-pilot-wholesale-central-bank-digital-currency-project"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Philippines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/residents-of-3-chinese-cities-paying-taxes-and-charges-with-digital-yuan"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">China</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ecb-eurosystem-begin-experimental-prototyping-of-digital-euro-customer-interface"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Europe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all announced significant developments on their CBDCs. This could be bad news for the crypto market. I‚Äôll explain why in a video later this week. Stay tuned.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üë®üèº‚Äçüè´ </span><b>Financial Literacy And Crypto</b><b>üë®üèº‚Äçüè´</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know I‚Äôm a bit late to the game, but I want to address a</span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-questions-on-financial-literacy-bitcoiners-flunk-bank-of-canada"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Bank of Canada that claims crypto holders have a low level of financial literacy. What caught my eye about the report was this quote ‚ÄúCanadians who were young, male, employed, had a university degree, high household income and relatively low financial literacy were more likely to own Bitcoin.‚Äù&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call me crazy, but this seems a bit counterintuitive. If someone is young, employed, educated, and has a high income, how can they have low financial literacy? Either the Canadian education system is one of the worst in the world, or the methodology of the study is flawed. Obviously, it‚Äôs the latter: they only asked 6 multiple choice questions to test financial literacy. Not exactly ideal.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This begs the question of whether this is intentional or just incompetence, and history suggests that the Bank of Canada is trying to push a narrative when it comes to cryptocurrency. Case in point, it published an</span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/are-we-dumb-financial-illiterates-twice-as-likely-to-own-crypto"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">almost identical report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September 2020, which implied that only people with low financial literacy invest in cryptocurrency. You aren‚Äôt financially illiterate, are you, anon?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jokes aside, there seems to be some truth to the statement. A great example is</span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/survey-21-of-uk-crypto-investors-say-they-know-almost-nothing-about-it"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from last summer which found that more than 1/5th of crypto investors in the UK basically have no idea what they‚Äôre buying. That‚Äôs definitely not a good sign, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily translate to a lack of financial literacy. In fact, there‚Äôs evidence which suggests the opposite.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a</span><a href="https://www.aboutschwab.com/generation-investor-study-2021"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Charles Schwab, 94% of people who first began investing in 2020 wanted to learn more about finance, and 90% intended to seek out information that will improve their investing skills. Even though this survey applied to stock investors, I reckon it‚Äôs the same or similar percentage among crypto investors, especially since there‚Äôs some retail overlap there.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another relevant report that comes to mind is a report by the Bank for International Settlements that I covered</span><a href="https://youtu.be/WnJbISKcsZU"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in a video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year. The most important statistic is that over 50% of crypto investors become long term holders. You could argue that this could be due to a phenomenon such as the</span><a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sunk cost fallacy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but I would argue this is evidence of education and awareness.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, I suspect the Bank of Canada is trying to convince Canadians that holding crypto means they know nothing about finance. In truth, financial literacy is one of the cornerstones of cryptocurrency. While it‚Äôs true that brand new crypto investors may not know much about it, those who stick around learn a lot, and I suspect that‚Äôs why the Bank of Canada is</span><a href="https://decrypt.co/98676/crypto-is-no-way-opt-out-inflation-canada"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">on this crusade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><b>ü§Ø&nbsp; Governance Reimagined ü§Ø</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite how revolutionary Web3 is, it does have its</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpaKQ3CZpVs"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fair share of concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of these relate to the reliance on centralised points of failure, on governance control and a lack of well thought out, long-term economic incentives.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are all fair criticisms.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why I was particularly excited to hear about Optimism‚Äôs latest</span><a href="https://app.optimism.io/governance"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">governance initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Of course, most of the focus was on the launch of the upcoming OP token, which I talked about in this</span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But, it was the governance and economic structure that came with the release that intrigued me the most.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have dubbed it the ‚ÄúOptimism Collective‚Äù and it's a new experiment in community funding and development focused around the principle of rewarding public goods. This is critical to Web3 infrastructure because their networks are by their very nature owned by the public.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central point of the Collective‚Äôs structure is two ‚Äúhouses‚Äù. Firstly, you have the Token House which will allow general token holders to govern functions such as the distribution of project incentives, protocol upgrades and treasury funds. This is where most Defi governance protocols stop.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the Citizens‚Äô House, retroactive public goods funding can be voted on. The concept is quite revolutionary and Vitalik proposed it himself in an Optimism blog</span><a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">post last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The TLDR of this is that it allows for the rewarding of public goods that benefit the ecosystem </span><b>retroactively</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means that the Citizens‚Äô House can reward those participants which have shown to provide a greater good to the overall community. This is quite an ingenious way of dealing with these rewards, as defined incentive structures can be quite hard to structure ex-ante.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of this, the Citizenship within the house will be granted by non-transferable NFTs that will be determined by both token holders and the foundation. These citizens within the house will also vote according to a</span><a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">quadratic mechanism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that reduces the weight of large token holders. This deals with particular concerns around whales having outsized voting power.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond governance, Optimism has also honed the economics such that they ensure the extensive revenue generated by the protocol creates an ecosystem-wide incentive for developers to build for the benefit of that public good. The stronger the public good, the more people who want to use it and the more revenue generated - a virtuous, value-accretive cycle.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Optimism team also seems to have spent quite a bit of time designing the airdrop distribution. Only a small portion (5%) will be</span><a href="https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/#airdrop-1-allocations"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">given retroactively</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it is heavily focused on those addresses that have been active in the Optimism and Ethereum ecosystem. For example, a portion of the drop will also be given to anyone who has participated in any DAO votes from well known ETH protocols.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, they have allocated a further 14% of the supply to future airdrops - the metrics of which have not been determined yet. This has the added benefit of making it much harder to ‚Äúgame‚Äù the airdrop mechanism. It further incentivises honest network use for the collective good.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there is a lot more to the Optimism Collective and token structure than this and I encourage you to read through the</span><a href="https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/economics/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">docs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or their</span><a href="https://twitter.com/optimismPBC/status/1519001562345005057"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tweet thread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn more about it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why am I telling you about this? No, I won‚Äôt be eligible for OP distribution and we have zero affiliation with the project.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just thought it was a really unique way to structure a Web 3 ecosystem and I think that other projects should take notes. It will be interesting to see how this evolves over the coming 1-2 years.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;üî•</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are constantly knocking on the doors of the biggest crypto exchanges and trying to get you an even better deal!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well today, I am pleased to say that FTX and FTX US have agreed to put up </span><b>one Bitcoin in a giveaway</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to you!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is </span><b>0.5 BTC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be given away on FTX and </span><b>0.5 BTC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on FTX US.

		<Title>Don‚Äôt Be Fooled! This Report Should Open Eyes!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know that it‚Äôs been a tough week in the markets. And it can be hard to focus on much else when your portfolio is looking the worse for wear.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it‚Äôs now more important than ever to stay focused on what really matters. And that is whether cryptocurrency can viably provide us with an alternative to the status quo. Whether we are still on the road to financial freedom (despite how bumpy it can get).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, thanks to a recent survey by the folks over at Bitstamp, we have a clearer picture of how the journey is going.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a comprehensive survey that incorporated 23,000 retail participants, as well as 5,500 institutions. This is in direct competition with the Gemini retail survey that I looked at a few weeks ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report covers a number of topics, including investor perceptions, geographical dispersion, regulations and adoption trends. It was a fascinating read and in my video today, I break down its most important points and explain exactly what they could mean for crypto this year and beyond.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/65QgI_Kzq38"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not making any more moves with the portfolio at this stage. As I mention in the market update below, we have an important week coming up, especially from a macro perspective. This will drive all asset markets and especially crypto.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If these numbers come in better than expected, then I will look to make strategic purchases with some of the stablecoins I have been stacking. I have already </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1522628324505305089"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asked you guys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what has value and there is some interesting feedback there.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, I will keep you updated with any changes in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram Channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 33.50% | BTC 23.74% | SOL 7.54% | UST 7.26% | DOT 5.45% | ATOM 4.01% | RUNE 3.15% | NEAR 2.47% | LUNA 2.47% | APE 2.02% | ADA 1.59% | HNT 1.32% | AR 1.30% | FTM 1.26% | MATIC 1.17% | INJ 0.86% | LINK 0.61% | XDEFI 0.29%</span><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 95.53% | Meebit 4.47%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve said it before, and I‚Äôll say it again. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre in a bear market just yet, and that‚Äôs because we continue to see a long term uptrend (higher lows on BTC) and a long term downtrend (lower lows) hasn‚Äôt begun. That said, we recently saw our first lower low since last spring when the crypto market looked like it was on its last legs. This begs the question: will this continue?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short answer is I‚Äôm honestly not sure, but what I am sure of is that asset markets are more or less moving as one. The only safe haven we‚Äôve seen over the last few weeks is the US dollar. Everything else - stocks, bonds, crypto, and gold have all been crashing. Now we‚Äôre starting to </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zillow-stock-falls-more-than-8-after-disappointing-forecast-in-uncertain-real-estate-environment-11651783008"><span style="font-weight: 400;">see signs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that even the housing market is losing its footing. You already know why that is.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation, pandemic, supply chain disruptions, China locking down, the ongoing war in Ukraine. It‚Äôs starting to feel like the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPb9ebUQbs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same old story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, isn‚Äôt it? Well, that‚Äôs the thing. Investors like certainty. The reality is that all of these factors are, for the most part, part of the same old story. They‚Äôve all been priced in, and they‚Äôre not really what investors are paying attention to at this point.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what the hell is spooking the markets so much? You know the answer here too: it‚Äôs the Federal Reserve. I covered the ins and outs of this in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUmyIqnSPxA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday‚Äôs video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Coin Bureau Clips, so I‚Äôll just repeat the most important point. This upcoming Wednesday, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will be publishing the inflation figures for April.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This CPI print is going to be extremely important, because what the markets are waiting for is ‚Äòpeak inflation‚Äô i.e. the top of the current inflation trend. Even if inflation comes in hot for April, if it‚Äôs lower or even just growing at a slower rate than it was in March, this will be seen as a bullish sign. Why? Because it means the Federal Reserve won‚Äôt have to raise interest rates as much as people were fearing.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if April‚Äôs CPI is higher than March‚Äôs CPI (and grew at a much faster pace), asset markets could take a very nasty tumble. This is because it means the Fed will be tempted to raise interest rates even more aggressively to fight inflation. The worst part is that lots of investors are convinced that March was</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/04/13/why-inflation-may-have-already-peaked"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> peak inflation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If it turns out that it wasn‚Äôt, then this could lead to even more capitulation.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, as horrible as this all sounds, it‚Äôs important to remember that there are a lot of fundamentals coming into force for cryptocurrency. Fidelity‚Äôs decision to introduce BTC to its 401(k) plans comes to mind here, but there are other potential bullish catalysts like Tesla accepting BTC as payment again and Australia listing those </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/failure-to-launch-australia-s-first-3-crypto-etfs-all-miss-launch-day"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delayed crypto ETFs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the week prior.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, it‚Äôs looking bad, but we‚Äôre not in bear market territory quite yet. I also didn‚Äôt get a single sense of bearishness from the attendees at yesterday‚Äôs Coin Bureau Conference. I even heard from a few folks that the impressive turnouts these crypto conferences continue to have is proof that the bear market isn‚Äôt here, or at least that crypto has entered a new paradigm.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üíØ</span><b>The First Coin Bureau Conference</b><b>üíØ</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where do I even begin? I suppose I should start by thanking each and everyone one of you; those who showed up in person, those who watched the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR93yACeNzxMSk6Y1cHM2pw/videos"><span style="font-weight: 400;">event online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the ones who made it possible (also you). I would also like to thank our fantastic sponsors (assuming they‚Äôre subscribed to our weekly newsletter of course). Now, enough thanking, here‚Äôs my two cents.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday was the first of many Coin Bureau conferences that will be coming your way, and based on the feedback we‚Äôve received so far, it was a big success. The venue was beautiful, the place was packed, and I managed to spend a fair bit of time with the fans in the crowd. I will admit it took some time for us to find some chairs, but I didn‚Äôt hear any complaints.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as content goes, naturally I started with a short opening speech, which was followed by a fantastic panel discussion featuring LunarCrush and Swissborg. On that note, I want to thank Swissborg for hosting an incredible event the night before and giving us pointers and tips on how to make ours as amazing as it could be. Seriously, check out Swissborg, and Lunar Crush too!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up I shared the stage with Tom and Josh from CryptoBusy and Yusuke from CoinClubJapan, where we discussed the evolution of altcoins. It was great to chew the fat with some fellow content creators and get an insight into their favourite projects. All lovely chaps as well. We then heard from some of the top brass over at Unique Network, a Polkadot project that you should definitely pay attention to.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief break, I opened the evening session with another short speech (because why not), and then we had what I considered to be among the most interesting discussions of the evening, and that was between LunarCrush and OGroup. It was also a blast having a chat with Rob from Digital Asset News, and incredible to see the stage light up in red for the one and only Maren Altman.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To wrap things up we did an in-depth DeFi discussion with DeFi Dad, and by ‚Äòwe‚Äô I mean myself and our energetic, 200-words-per-minute head of crypto research, Dan the man. The night ended with an equally energetic and in-depth discussion about Decentralised Autonomous Organisations, their adoption, their issues, and how they could potentially be improved.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, a solid event, and again, no spoilers here. Head on over to Coin Bureau Clips and watch </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR93yACeNzxMSk6Y1cHM2pw/videos"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the whole thing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (pro tip, 2x speed and remember to skip around as there are some transition parts as well). We will be pushing shorter clips from the event over the next few weeks as well, so keep your eyes peeled for that because the highlights will be sweet!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an exhausting but exhilarating day, all told. Our speakers and sponsors were wonderful and all such lovely people too. It was a pleasure to meet them all and I‚Äôm so grateful for their support. A big thank you too to the wonderful Team Coin Bureau. They worked their socks off all day to keep the show on the road and I was delighted to see them getting some love from the fans too. Coin Bureau couldn‚Äôt function without them and I‚Äôm lucky to be a part of such an elite unit! Special thanks of course to Macey, who worked so tirelessly to make the whole thing happen. A few days rest and then I guess she better start thinking about the next one‚Ä¶</span><b>üßê&nbsp; A Tale of Two Blockchains üßê</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last weekend we had two very different examples of how blockchains deal with excessive demand on their networks. These were Ethereum &amp; Solana. Both of these networks faced this demand thanks to NFTs. In the case of Solana, it was an </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-01/solana-suffers-seven-hour-outage-as-nft-demand-spills-over"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFT Minting tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and with Ethereum, it was the </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/99219/otherside-nft-mint-burned-more-157m-ethereum"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherside land drop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it relates to Solana, it suffered a 7 hour outage thanks to an </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-01/solana-suffers-seven-hour-outage-as-nft-demand-spills-over"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFT minting tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called ‚ÄúCandy Machine‚Äù that was swarmed by bots. Essentially, the network was flooded with transactions that were too numerous for the validators to process, which in turn led to the network fork.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, on the Ethereum side, the Otherside mint led to an </span><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/bayc-metaverse-otherside-mint-gas-fees-analysis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unprecedented spike</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in gas fees, which saw buyers paying over $100m in fees for the mint. Not only did many view this as extortionate, but it also raised ETH fees for the entire network. For example, there was </span><a href="https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1520576604996579328"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this person</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who paid $3,800 in fees for a $270 NFT.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both of these cases, it left some community members feeling a bit jaded about the state of their blockchains. It wasn‚Äôt a pretty picture for either of these networks. However, what this did illustrate is that when it comes to demand for block space, there is no free lunch.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Etherem, it was those individuals who were consistently bidding up the gas fees in order to mint those NFTs. The free market on that day determined that some people valued those NFT mints more than others were willing to pay for simple transactions.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Solana, its </span><a href="https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/transaction-fees#congestion-driven-fees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">algorithmic fee model</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was developed to adjust based on how full the previous blocks were. The only problem is that this model could underprice the block space and hence allow a flood of low value transactions. Spam attacks tend to happen when the cost of spamming isn‚Äôt that high. Moreover, given the open nature of a blockchain, you can‚Äôt really ‚Äòban‚Äô any dapps.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in Ethereum‚Äôs case, fees were so high that people found it unusable. Yet, with Solana, they could not use it because, well, it was inoperable.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not just a Solana or Ethereum thing. All other networks could face similar challenges in the future. When network demand gets so great, you have to find a solution that keeps fees manageable without risking spam.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are blockchains that are trying to do this and they are having varying degrees of success. And, even if they do demonstrate the ability to scale as desired, this generally comes at the cost of decentralisation.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the opening chord of a much broader discussion of the blockchain trilemma: a problem that has been around for as long as blockchains themselves.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are like the Coin Bureau team then you are hodling those coins and tokens in a super secure </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t3Brlb0qzQ&amp;t"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hardware wallet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But, what happens if you misplace that hardware wallet?

That‚Äôs why it is so important to keep them as safe as possible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The security risk most people face when it comes to seed words is that they write them down on just a piece of paper or card. Unfortunately, both cardboard and paper are not exactly resistant to spillages, fire, damp and other mishaps.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is a way to keep those seed words safe.

		<Title>Here Are The Q1 Stats - It‚Äôs a Bear Market!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It‚Äôs been a tough week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only did we have the complete collapse of Terra (more about that below) but the entire crypto market took a bath in the process. We‚Äôre now in full bear market territory and it‚Äôs quite clear that we're in for some volatile times.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apart from the Terra saga and the high inflation numbers, we also had the Q1 Earnings Report from one of the most recognisable crypto companies in the space - Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The numbers were not good and led to a nasty fall in Coinbase‚Äôs stock. In fact, the market is now valuing Coinbase on a P/E ratio that is pretty unheard of for a publicly traded company.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is this justified? Or is it an overreaction to the current market conditions?<br><br>Well, that‚Äôs exactly what I explore today. Not only is this report essential for anyone interested in Coinbase‚Äôs stock price, but it‚Äôs also a bellwether for what crypto market conditions we can expect over the course of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>You can watch my <a href="https://youtu.be/j1DMvzQv5Ak">video here.</a></p>

<p><strong>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given that LUNA completely collapsed, it‚Äôs worth nothing in my portfolio now and I have taken it out of my calculation below. When it came to my UST holdings, following the depegging, I traded it for BTC &amp; ETH in equal proportions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right now, I am not making any more purchases and will be hodling on for the next few days at least. If I am ever to hold my ‚Äúdry powder‚Äù in stablecoin again, I will go back to spreading it between more than one stablecoin. Diversification is key‚Ä¶</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>üìà <strong>Thoughts on Market üìà</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One word: bloodbath, and there were many reasons for it. I suppose I should begin with the elephant in the room: Terra. After UST started to lose its peg, Terra‚Äôs Luna Foundation Guard <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/terra-luna-foundation-guard-dumps-150721620.html#:~:text=LFG%20sells%20treasury's%20Bitcoin,(BTC)%20from%20its%20treasury.">began selling</a> the billions of dollars in BTC it had stockpiled to try and restore its peg and reduce the sell pressure on LUNA. It‚Äôs safe to say that move <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitkwonnect-luna-brothers-moment-sees-terra-inflate-token-supply-3-500-overnight">failed</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although most of the LFG‚Äôs sales of BTC probably occurred OTC, I suspect that there was some spot selling somewhere along the way, as evidenced by BTC‚Äôs continued price decline. As UST continued to depeg, it caused chaos across the crypto ecosystem, since UST had listed on multiple <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/43d0f0d01c6a42a7941c9ecd1a1ae94b">exchanges</a> and was being used in numerous decentralised and <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/146752/celsius-pulled-half-a-billion-dollars-out-of-anchor-protocol-amid-terra-chaos">centralised applications</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that the altcoins most affected during the drawdown were those that were heavily DeFi focused, i.e. those with lots of exposure to UST, namely <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/anchor-protocol-on-avax-get-20-yield-on-your-stables-6bff5461635f">Avalanche</a>. Unfortunately for Avalanche, the LFG had bought up 200 million dollars worth of AVAX as part of its reserves, and <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/b31cc9e5-c54c-4418-a6ce-b332c57e82e9/page/4YBqC?s=or-T7NeGLew">it appears they</a> sold some of it to protect UST‚Äôs peg as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coincidentally, the Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/09/new-fed-report-repeats-warning-about-stablecoin-run-risks-as-ust-loses-peg/">released</a> a financial stability report that mentioned the risk of a run on the banks with stablecoins (which I‚Äôll be covering in an upcoming video, by the way). Not surprisingly, this thoroughly spooked the crypto market, and everyone started worrying that regulators will crack down on stablecoins. This likely played a role in the <a href="https://decrypt.co/100173/tether-loses-dollar-peg-ongoing-stablecoin-crisis">slight depegging</a> of Tether‚Äôs USDT.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The carnage continued into the middle of the week, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen making <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-12/yellen-says-terra-meltdown-demonstrates-crypto-stablecoin-risks?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google">off the cuff</a> comments about Terra during her testimony on Thursday. The same day however, the crypto market started to see a bit of a relief rally, and it seems to have started because of Janet - <a href="https://decrypt.co/100212/yellen-crypto-systemic-risk">she mentioned</a> that crypto doesn‚Äôt currently pose a systemic risk to financial markets.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another nugget of good news was that Australian stock exchanges <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/aussie-crypto-etfs-see-1-3m-volume-so-far-on-difficult-launch-day">finally listed</a> their first two crypto ETFs. Too bad the inflows weren‚Äôt enough to move the markets, and the news was all but missed. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-senate-confirms-jerome-powell-for-another-four-years-as-fed-chair">officially confirmed</a> for another term, creating certainty among investors and potentially adding to positive price action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were also some surprisingly positive developments in China, specifically Shanghai. A court there ruled that Bitcoin counts as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/shanghai-court-affirms-that-bitcoin-is-virtual-property-subject-to-property-rights">virtual property</a>, potentially opening the door to more crypto investment and ownership in the country. The last reassuring stat I‚Äôll hit you with is Bitcoin‚Äôs hash rate, which hit <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-network-fortifies-as-mining-difficulty-records-ath-of-31-251t">yet another</a> all time high about a day ago.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, obviously we‚Äôre nowhere close to being out of the woods, and it‚Äôs pretty clear that we seem to be entering rather than exiting the depths of a bear market. There‚Äôs really no telling how low we could go, but I see many people calling for 20k, given that it was the previous bull market top. In the meantime, be on the lookout for a long-overdue relief rally.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>üò±&nbsp; Takes on Terra‚Äôs Terror üò±</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was one of the most unprecedented weeks in the history of crypto. In fewer than 3 days, a project with a combined market cap of over $35 billion completely collapsed. It really could be considered a Lehman moment in the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I detailed exactly how the peg was broken and how the attack took place in <a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1961">my Telegram post</a> the day after.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is so much to cover about the failure of UST and the complete annihilation of LUNA and I will be doing a comprehensive video for you next week. And, I have covered some of the most important lessons that could be learned from the collapse in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfJ2b8A1FKo">recent livestream</a>. However, there were some additional thoughts that I wanted to share with readers of this newsletter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>‚ÄúSmart‚Äù People Can Get Things Wrong:</strong> Part of the reason why Terra &amp; Luna managed to avoid the shitcoin and ponzi label is because of the fact that they had some ‚ÄúGigabrains‚Äù backing them. VCs &amp; hedge funds that brought billions of firepower to the project. People wrongly assumed that, because of this institutional backing, it was more reputable than other projects. But, as we learned in the 2008 financial crisis, sometimes the smartest people in the world can be really wrong. Terra‚Äôs economics was crypto‚Äôs equivalent of a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/09/13/credit-rating-agencies-2008-financial-crisis-lehman/2759025/">AAA-rated CDO</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Risk Management &amp; Diversification:</strong> The people who got most badly burnt by the collapse were those who invested more than they could afford to lose, and invested it all in LUNA or UST through Anchor. Of course, it didn‚Äôt help that there were some influencers out there giving <a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1494076067669168130">terrible advice</a>. The LUNA position I had was worth less than 2.5% of my overall portfolio and I took a 10% loss on my UST position (which was 7%). So, combined that was about a 3% loss in my total portfolio. Of course, this was painful, but it‚Äôs manageable. It‚Äôs now more important than ever to understand the risks of overleveraging yourself in a highly concentrated portfolio.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Never Dismiss All Criticism</strong>: There were many people who highlighted concerns about the Terra Ecosystem and its susceptibility to death spirals. These concerns were all justified, but they were completely dismissed by the founder. He <a href="https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1464897977793728514">insulted someone</a> who shared a thread detailing a potential Terra attack - the <strong>exact one</strong> eventually used! There seems to be a culture of dismissing critiques of your crypto as ‚ÄúFUD‚Äù and, they may often be. However, by carefully and constructively addressing ‚ÄúFUD‚Äù, it could allow you to discover some landmines in your portfolio.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Avoid Projects With ‚ÄúGod‚Äù Figures: </strong>It was quite clear that Do Kwon was raised to a God-like status in the Terra community. Too many people relied on his every word and followed him religiously. This created a God delusion, where he mocked anyone who criticised him. He even <a href="https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1506494471873081352">famously tweeted</a> this gem less than 2 months ago. Despite these antics, many were hoping Do would have a magic fix for Terra (one which never came). Yes, it is true that there are other projects with popular founders. But, the ones that will truly survive are those where the founders have gone to great lengths to reduce their roles and influence.</li><li><strong>Maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe‚Ä¶ some regulation?: </strong>I know that this could be seen as sacrilege, but there is no doubt that stablecoin regulations would have prevented $UST from becoming the uncontrollable and unstable force that it did. The idea of at least some common sense regulation should not be scoffed at. It‚Äôs a point that Rob from Digital Asset News made in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36FfVsXPgd8">our fireside chat</a> at the Coin Bureau Conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>Of course, there are going to be many more lessons to be learned and I can‚Äôt wait to do a deeper dive into this sorry saga in an upcoming video.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also want to add that I know that many people lost a lot from this. But, take it from someone who has made and lost some serious sums before (and knows many who have too) - We‚Äôre All Going To Make It üôè</p>

<p>üåÖ <strong>Failure Should Be An Option</strong> <strong>üåÖ</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While all the news was coming out about Terra‚Äôs implosion, there was an interesting headline that caught my eye. This was reporting about <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/11/failure-should-be-an-option-senator-pat-toomey-says-of-ust-turmoil/">a comment</a> that US politician Pat Toomey made in response to Terra‚Äôs collapse, and that‚Äôs that ‚Äúfailure should be an option - it‚Äôll probably take some failures in this space in order for the market to figure out what works." Wise words.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This got me thinking, because in crypto, failure is always a possibility, and there <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-rescue-for-terra-swiss-asset-manager-denies-3b-luna-ust-bail-out-talks">isn‚Äôt always</a> a VC or angel investor willing to bail your project out. There are hacks, exploits, scams, rug pulls, pump and dumps, and sometimes projects that just fail. In this and other ways, the philosophy in crypto is very different from the philosophy in today‚Äôs wider society.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In our society, the authorities see failure as something that cannot be allowed to occur by any means. The craziest part is that this aversion to failure is instilled as early as childhood, with schools in many Western countries basically <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeigel/2013/10/08/its-wrong-for-schools-to-be-banning-balls-and-games-at-recess/?sh=283b49b82d78">banning sports</a> so that nobody feels like they lost or were left out. I‚Äôm sure many of you have heard about those participation trophies too.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I'm not all that surprised when the authorities at other levels of the societal structure implement similarly protective policies. In the case of the Federal Reserve and the like, there seems to be a sort of imperative to ensure that no companies fail, least of all the big banks. Heck, there‚Äôs <a href="https://youtu.be/F27Wqgdz6fw">a division</a> of the US government whose explicit purpose is to prevent stock market crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In short, failure is frowned upon at every level in society, yet in crypto it is allowed to flourish. Failure allows newer and better projects to come in, and it allows existing projects to learn from the mistakes of others. Fun fact: sometimes forest fires are<a href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/forests/wildland-fires-insects-disturbances/why-forests-need-fires-insects-and-diseases/13081"> required</a> for forests to remain healthy. In some places, preventing forest fires for so long is what‚Äôs been making them worse; fear of failure! Jordan Peterson talked eloquently about this during his appearance at Bitcoin Miami last month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This begs the question of how long regulators and politicians can postpone the failure of the current financial system. I say postpone, because at this point it‚Äôs inevitable. Financial institutions are on the brink of being replaced by cryptocurrency, and the fiat system we have now is starting to inflate itself away. To what extent will they go to prevent this failure? Are <a href="https://youtu.be/Vb1Y760Sazc">CBDCs</a> their only hope?&nbsp;</p>

		<Title>The Coming Crisis - It‚Äôs Not What You Think!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs face it - 2022 has thrown all kinds of crazy at us.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">War, inflation, pandemic, geopolitics and general turmoil. While I have covered many of these on the channel before, none come quite as close to the biggest risk of all - a global food crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first I wanted to believe that talk of food shortages was nothing but alarmism. But, after seeing some of these shortages in my local grocery store, it began to dawn on me that there may be something more to talk about.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the head of the Bank of England warned that we were heading towards a global food crisis, I thought I'd dig a little deeper into what is going on.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my video today, I break down exactly what‚Äôs happening with the global food supply chain. Despite what many may think, it‚Äôs not all entirely related to the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a combination of factors that are threatening a food shortage the likes of which we haven‚Äôt seen since the second world war.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/EdkJj2KyNi4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/2006"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post yesterday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in this bear market I want to gain more exposure to BTC &amp; ETH. The former because it performs better in these conditions vs. alts, and the latter because of the upcoming merge. As such, I sold out of 10% of all positions in other altcoins and allocated the proceeds to BTC &amp; ETH in equal proportion.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, I will keep you updated with moves in </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my Telegram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Updated portfolio is:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 40.34% | BTC 31.90% | SOL 6.27% | DOT 5.16% | ATOM 3.59% | RUNE 2.07% | NEAR 1.87% | APE 1.71% | ADA 1.47% | AR 1.30% | FTM 0.99% | MATIC 0.99% | HNT 0.98% | INJ 0.70% | LINK 0.54% | XDEFI 0.12%</span><b>üñº NFT Portfolio üñº</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAYC 94.62% | Meebit 5.38%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems the crypto market has finally found some support after Terra‚Äôs terrifying collapse. What‚Äôs interesting is that around 274 million dollars flowed into crypto funds during that week - the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/16/crypto-funds-saw-years-highest-inflows-as-terra-crisis-crashed-markets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highest inflows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the start of the year. As noted by Coinshares, this suggests that institutions took Terra‚Äôs fallout as an opportunity to buy the dip. Not everyone is buying, though.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One on-chain metric we‚Äôve been keeping a close eye on lately is how much BTC Bitcoin miners </span><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=distribution.BalanceMinersChange"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been selling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not surprisingly, they‚Äôve been selling quite a bit, and though the selling wave seems to have peaked, it‚Äôs not quite over yet. This makes sense given that a </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miners-can-take-fresh-20-btc-price-hit-before-capitulating-data-shows"><span style="font-weight: 400;">January report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found a BTC price below 34k means many Bitcoin miners would have to sell to stay solvent.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that we‚Äôre finally starting to see what‚Äôs left of the speculative greed flushed out of the crypto market, as shown by the sudden spike in </span><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Dominance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This corresponds to </span><a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extreme fear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index, which is a level that we haven‚Äôt seen since March 2020. For context, the Fear &amp; Greed Index factors in Bitcoin Dominance.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Ethereum looks like it‚Äôs on schedule to transition from proof of work to proof of stake as soon as </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-devs-tip-the-merge-will-occur-in-august-if-everything-goes-to-plan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is significantly sooner than the revised 2023 timeline, which has since </span><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been updated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Q3/Q4 2022 on Ethereum‚Äôs official roadmap. This news probably played a role in the small rally we saw in the crypto market at the end of last week.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an additional bonus, we just finished 8 weeks of losses for BTC, something that has </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/video/chart-of-the-day/bitcoin-sees-7-straight-weeks-of-losses-for-first-time-in-history/#:~:text=Bitcoin%20has%20had%20seven%20straight,risks%20in%20the%20crypto%20sector."><span style="font-weight: 400;">never</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> been seen since Bitcoin began in 2009. As we‚Äôve been saying, there‚Äôs only so long that prices can go down, but then again, BTC‚Äôs spectacular long term decline might be because of its increased correlation with the stock markets, which </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-end-higher-friday-but-dow-books-worst-7-weeks-of-declines-in-two-years-2022-05-13"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have seen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 7+ week declines before.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We‚Äôre seeing some interesting moves at the macro level as well. The one that seems to have brought the crypto market back up a bit late last week was China‚Äôs </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-20/china-cuts-borrowing-costs-by-record-to-boost-loan-demand"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sudden decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cut interest rates. Some are seeing this as a sign that other central banks could slow their interest rate increases, but the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/17/powell-says-the-fed-will-not-hesitate-to-keep-raising-rates-until-inflation-comes-down.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent rhetoric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Fed chairman Jerome Powell suggests otherwise.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is one thing that could cause central banks to reverse course however, and that‚Äôs another pandemic. It now appears as if the new scare is the monkeypox virus. The </span><a href="https://bnonews.com/monkeypox/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was detected here in London earlier this month, and it seems to be getting serious because the US government recently announced a </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/05/19/us-buys-millions-of-monkeypox-vaccines-after-massachusetts-case/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">big purchase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of monkeypox vaccines in response.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many of you will know, monkeypox can be deadly, and there‚Äôs also apparently </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/treatment.html#:~:text=Currently%2C%20there%20is%20no%20proven,(VIG)%20can%20be%20used."><span style="font-weight: 400;">no treatment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for it. The only real protection is to get exposed to a weakened version of the virus. What‚Äôs scary is that an unspecified European country also purchased vaccines </span><a href="https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/jynneos-smallpox-monkeypox-vaccine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the day after</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the US. The World Health Organisation even held an </span><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/05/20/monkeypox-outbreak-doubles-health-authorities-set-announce-11/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emergency meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Friday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So yeah, this new situation seems to be getting serious, but so far it looks like the markets haven‚Äôt picked it up. I seriously hope it‚Äôs much ado about nothing, but I also thought that about Covid back in 2019! So, this is one of those known unknowns we should be keeping our eyes on.&nbsp;</span><b>ü§î Liquid Staking And Centralisation Risks ü§î</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve been interested in liquid staking for quite some time now, and after seeing all the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/03/smart-money-is-staking-eth-on-rocket-pool-and-selling-ens-nansen-data-suggests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data by Nansen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggesting that institutions are increasingly staking their ETH in liquid staking protocols, I realised that we needed to do a deep dive into one of these platforms. I‚Äôll be covering Lido Finance to start, since it‚Äôs the largest. As far as Ethereum goes, Lido now holds 33% of all staked ETH.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can imagine, this has led to lots of debates about whether this staking distribution threatens Ethereum‚Äôs security once it transitions to proof of stake, especially since </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/18/will-a-proof-of-stake-ethereum-lead-to-more-centralization/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many believe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lido will hold 50% of all staked ETH in the near future. Lido </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1527618878112772096?s=20&amp;t=Io6AkvPYEysD6XVrJJp0rw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">isn‚Äôt the only </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">entity staking lots of ETH on behalf of ETH holders either, and they‚Äôre also likely to see the same sort of adoption.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, some (including me) would argue that the gradual centralisation of stake is one of the many inevitabilities of proof of stake, but there seems to be more to this particular story. That‚Äôs because Lido and other liquid staking platforms only hold </span><a href="https://lido.fi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a fraction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the stake for the other proof of stake cryptocurrencies they support. As far as I can tell, Ethereum is the only outlier.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This begs the question of what‚Äôs going on, and I think the answer is obvious: opportunity cost. At the moment, anyone who stakes ETH must </span><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/staking/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keep it locked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until sometime after Ethereum transitions to proof of stake. Even then, it sounds like there‚Äôs going to be caps on how much validators can withdraw so as to not crash</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH‚Äôs price, since many will probably want to sell.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that the exact timing of Ethereum‚Äôs transition to proof of stake is uncertain, it‚Äôs quite rational to stake using a third party platform that lets you freely trade that staked ETH in a tokenised form. The reason why we don‚Äôt see the same phenomenon with other proof of stake cryptocurrencies is ultimately certainty around opportunity cost: the lock / unlock </span><a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, it‚Äôs possible we will see a slowdown in the popularity of liquid staking providers for Ethereum once there‚Äôs certainty around when exactly Ethereum will transition to proof of stake and how long ETH stakers will have to wait before being able to sell. The paradox is that this certainty will probably only come once Ethereum has actually transitioned to proof of stake.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this mean Ethereum‚Äôs proof of stake will begin with a centralised validator set? Well, not exactly. That‚Äôs because Lido and other liquid staking providers run multiple validator nodes for each cryptocurrency to support its decentralisation. There is of course a discussion to be had about whether that counts as decentralisation, and I actually just did a video about </span><a href="https://youtu.be/9ybYhv_VFaE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that topic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, it sounds like Ethereum is pushing ahead with proof of stake regardless of this supposed staking risk. This makes sense given that Ethereum‚Äôs </span><a href="https://beaconcha.in/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beacon Chain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is closing in on a whopping 400 thousand validators. This will almost certainly make Ethereum the most decentralised cryptocurrency out there. Too bad it won‚Äôt do all that much for scalability.&nbsp;</span><b>üò±&nbsp; Wall Street Sharks Circling üò±</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs been over 2 weeks since the collapse of Terra‚Äôs UST. Since that time, it has received extensive coverage from the crypto and mainstream media alike. We recently did a complete deep dive into the matter in our </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CutSymg94I"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post-mortem video.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don‚Äôt want to get into the discussion of whether the protocol was poorly designed and hence was susceptible to the ‚Äúdeath spiral‚Äù. It is clear that this was earlier brought to their attention and Do Kwon‚Äôs brash dismissal is coming back to haunt him.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My broader question is who could have been behind the attack and whether there were other intentions?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading some of the comments on my video, some appeared to dismiss the notion that this attack could have come from outside the crypto space.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I still believe that this was the actions of someone in TradeFi (or not connected to crypto at all).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is because anyone who operates in crypto knew how much collateral damage there would be from a collapse. A collapse that was many multiples of the potential gains they would have made in the exploit. By some estimates, the attacker was able to make about $800m + in gains from the attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you count the damage to the Terra ecosystem (including the Terra blockchain and all those projects built on Terra), it was over $80bn or more. Then of course you have to consider the negative market impact this had on the broader crypto sector. The market dump drove mass liquidations and price volatility that rekt many new investors.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of this, there was also the risk of the FUD spreading to other stablecoins. As we saw, there was a massive run on redemptions of USDT and this led to a fall from the peg. Thankfully, the fear subsided, the peg was regained and Tether took steps to cut </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/19/tether-cut-commercial-paper-reserve-by-17-in-q1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its commercial paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, the attack itself increased the likelihood of this </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/1994"><span style="font-weight: 400;">black swan event.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not even the money that was lost in the attack. The collapse has drawn a great deal of attention from regulators all around the world. From </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/10/ust-woes-draw-spotlight-in-janet-yellens-senate-hearing-on-financial-risks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the US</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/20/uk-regulator-to-consider-terra-coins-collapse-in-new-crypto-rules-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the UK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/g7-countries-urge-swift-regulation-crypto-assets-draft-2022-05-19/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EU and in Asia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They needed an excuse to come after crypto and this was a golden ticket.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, as mentioned in my newsletter last week, there is a case to be made for common sense regulations. But, as we have seen so many times in the past, reactionary regulations are the norm in periods of distress.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then of course there is the negative publicity that came from the collapse. The stories of people who have lost their life savings in crypto are bound to slow adoption. The media is having a field day with the Terra collapse. And, while they are justified in their attacks of the project and founder itself, they are turning this into an attack on the broader crypto industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is that none of this was good for the crypto space. And if you are a company, hedge fund, VC, investor or project founder, this attack was against your own interests. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs for this reason that I think the attack emanated from somewhere outside of crypto.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps they were being opportunistic and decided to take advantage of a vulnerable protocol. Or perhaps they knew the damage that it would cause and viewed the profit of the attack as a sweetener - we lack the evidence to prove anything.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, let‚Äôs hope that we learn something from it. That we build stronger and more robust protocols and we avoid getting caught up in the hubris of Defi dreams. Crypto will survive if we can adapt quicker than the TradeFi sharks can attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üíª </span><b>Want A Job In Crypto?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üíª</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common questions that we get asked is: How do I get a job in crypto?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, it can sometimes be tough to navigate the talent space in crypto. Many seem to be intimidated by the fact that they are still new to crypto. Others may think that their non-programmer background could limit the pool of available roles.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the truth is that crypto is such a vast ecosystem now, that there is probably a job out there right now that is perfectly suited for your experience or background. The industry is starving for talent of all types and despite hiring freezes at other tech companies, crypto job openings are </span><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/news/crypto-jobs-still-accelerating-despite-hiring-freezes-in-tech-industry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">still accelerating. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talent that can command top tier pay packages.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to assess your job options in the crypto industry and see if you can find the right job for you?

		<Title>How Long Will This Bear Market Last?!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the bear market has indisputably begun, many of you have been asking me how long I think it could last. Is this a temporary shakeout where we will see a recovery in a few months, or is this the beginning of a long and cold crypto winter?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truthfully, the answer is not that clear cut. That‚Äôs because there are so many variables that determine the length and severity of a bear market. And, although we have had crypto bear markets before, the landscape has changed considerably since the 2018 crypto winter.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some factors, such as investor profiles, have improved, but the global macro picture itself is a lot worse today than it was in 2018.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in my video today, I'll be giving you a complete overview of how long this bear market is likely to last. I will break down some of the key things to consider when planning for this market downturn.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also give you my view as to where some of these cryptocurrencies are likely to go when these turbulent times finally end.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxJvZMEYF8w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes to the portfolio this week. Will keep it top heavy in BTC &amp; ETH for the time being. As I mentioned in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/2006"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week, I would caution against going heavily into alts under these market conditions.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updated portfolio is:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 39.53% | BTC 34.18% | SOL 5.86% | DOT 5.31% | ATOM 3.30% | RUNE 1.93% | NEAR 1.63% | APE 1.50% | ADA 1.39% | AR 1.20% | MATIC 0.96% | HNT 0.94% | FTM 0.93% | INJ 0.67% | LINK 0.54% | XDEFI 0.12%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there we have it - the 9th straight week of price decline for BTC. It‚Äôs the longest losing streak in Bitcoin‚Äôs history, and it looks like it‚Äôs likely to continue. That‚Äôs because the crypto market has </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-27/bitcoin-extends-worst-losing-streak-since-2011-as-crypto-swoons?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social"><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially decoupled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the stock market, but not in a good way. While the stock market starts to recover, the crypto market continues to crash. So, what the hell is going on? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first possibility is that investors still aren‚Äôt feeling brave enough to take on additional risks by investing in cryptocurrencies. This might have something to do with </span><a href="https://youtu.be/0CutSymg94I"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terra‚Äôs recent collapse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which spooked crypto investors in many different ways. The full extent of the fallout is still being assessed, but the general consensus is that crypto regulations are coming. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second possibility is that individuals and institutions just aren‚Äôt investing as much, be it because of inflation or uncertainty. As per the Federal Reserve‚Äôs </span><a href="https://youtu.be/qtw63xctGGg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there isn‚Äôt all that much money sloshing around in the markets. This leads to increased volatility to both the upside and the downside, which could explain the disconnect between crypto and stocks.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third possibility is that cryptocurrency has entered a bear market, and if you watched today‚Äôs video you‚Äôll know that this certainly seems to be the case. Make no mistake though, crypto isn‚Äôt dead. There are still </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/andreessen-horowitz-closes-4-5-billion-crypto-fund-amid-market-turmoil"><span style="font-weight: 400;">billions of dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pouring in from VCs, and crypto was a hot topic at the World Economic Forum‚Äôs recent conference. We‚Äôll be covering that later this week.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third possibility is the most probable, and we‚Äôre finally starting to see signs of capitulation among altcoins. Not only has Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance increased relative to altcoins, but even Ethereum‚Äôs dominance has started to drop. This seems to be because of </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-beacon-chain-experiences-7-block-reorg-what-s-going-on"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an issue </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that was detected on Ethereum‚Äôs Beacon Chain which might have delayed The Merge.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that The Merge was one of the only big bullish milestones coming up for the crypto market, the prospect of </span><a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1530455080826445824?s=20&amp;t=oQpwyMyedRfx1JwfHV7XSA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a delay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is really dragging down the crypto market. One of the other bullish milestones in the works is the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, but it looks like the SEC isn‚Äôt budging - they recently </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/one-river-s-spot-bitcoin-etf-application-rejected-by-sec"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> another application and a carbon neutral one at that!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, there seems to be lots of FUD floating around about Tether. This is because over 10 billion USDT </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/23/tether-usdt-stablecoin-withdrawals-top-10-billion.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been redeemed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the last couple of weeks. This has led to worries that USDT will fail due to a run on the bank, but I‚Äôm not so convinced. Allow me to explain‚Ä¶&nbsp;</span><b>ü§ì&nbsp; </b><b>Why Tether Is Not A Ticking Time Bomb</b><b> ü§ì</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you all know, USDT is the largest stablecoin by market cap. Just about every single cryptocurrency trades against USDT as the de facto dollar pair. This is why it‚Äôs one of the </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/crypto-top-volume-24hr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most traded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cryptocurrencies, occasionally even surpassing BTC and ETH. It should go without saying then that any problems with USDT would translate to an even bigger problem for cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDT is issued by Tether, a crypto company that hasn‚Äôt been the most transparent about its operations. It also has a </span><a href="https://youtu.be/dPJGZny8kOE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">peculiar relationship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. Tether‚Äôs relative lack of transparency and its association with Bitfinex have landed it in hot water with regulators before, but the bigger issue is the question about the assets backing USDT.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôve watched </span><a href="https://youtu.be/TxcTDNHSS-U"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the assets backing the largest stablecoins, you‚Äôll know that all three (USDT, USDC, BUSD) are backed primarily by different kinds of debt. Whereas USDC and BUSD are mostly backed by government debt, USDT is mostly backed by riskier types of corporate debt. To be fair, Tether has noted that it's </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/97754/tether-promises-continue-cutting-commercial-paper-holdings"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of cutting down this debt.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, the concern here is that the assets backing USDT are harder to sell for the same price at short notice. This means that if too many USDT holders tried to cash out via Tether at the same time, Tether might not have enough US dollars to give them. This concern is a part of why USDT </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/usdt-dollar-peg-wobbles-as-markets-continue-to-struggle-tether-cto-weighs-in"><span style="font-weight: 400;">briefly lost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its dollar peg during Terra‚Äôs implosion - that and regulatory concerns.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned a few moments ago, 10 billion dollars worth of USDT has been redeemed over the last two weeks, and Tether hasn‚Äôt flinched - it's managed to provide dollars to those who demanded them. Not surprisingly, many of those who cashed out seem to have </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-18/circle-s-usd-coin-reaps-the-benefits-of-tether-circulation-drop"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taken their dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Circle and Paxos to mint USDC and BUSD, because these two issuers are regulated.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this is exactly why Tether is not a ticking time bomb - USDT holders are volunarily rotating into stablecoins with more regulatory certainty, and it‚Äôs possible if not likely that this process will continue. Assuming that Tether has enough dollars for USDT holders to cash out (which </span><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sam-bankman-fried-tether-crypto-ftx-bitcoin-stablecoin-miami-fraud-2021-10"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seems to be the case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), then USDT‚Äôs decline will be a slow transition to safety, not a run on the bank.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call me crazy, but I think Tether can see the shift that‚Äôs occurring among stablecoin holders in the crypto market. This is because of all the headlines like </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/other-flavors-of-tether-will-bridge-users-to-usdt-paolo-ardoino"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that talk about how Tether is going to continue expanding and improving etc. This is a rhetoric that I have not heard before, and it‚Äôs a sign that we‚Äôre headed for some interesting times. As if those we're in aren't interesting enough.</span><b>üêª Bear Market Expectations üêª</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we appear to be at the beginning of a bear market, it‚Äôs an important time to take a cold, hard look at your portfolios with a critical eye. That‚Äôs because of the unfortunate reality that some cryptocurrencies, which you thought may have had amazing potential, are unlikely to achieve those previous highs again.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is based purely on previous experience from the 2018-2020 bear market. Prior to that time, there were a number of cryptocurrencies that ranked near the top of CMC, had extensive exchange support and were the staples of many people‚Äôs portfolios.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can view the </span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20171224/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">historical rankings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on CMC for yourself. Some of the cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash, IOTA &amp; DASH reached dizzying highs in the previous bull markets. However, they never reached those highs again.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don't mean to single out these cryptocurrencies, as there are many other coins lower down on the list that also haven‚Äôt recovered. It‚Äôs also not an indictment on a project if the coin or token hasn‚Äôt been able to reach those previous highs again. Sometimes, no matter how much potential a project may have and how amazing its tech is, the market perpetually discounts it.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What this means is that there are likely to be a number of other cryptocurrencies that reached all time highs in the 2021 bull market that are unlikely to recover.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also likely to play out to a large degree in the NFT space. I am of the view that at least 95% of the most highly hyped collections are unlikely to ever recover. During the NFT mania of last year, there was too much saturation and insane speculation, which will lead to capitulation.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now of course, I don‚Äôt know what your portfolio looks like. You may have a solid selection of really promising cryptocurrencies that are likely to outlast this bear market and thrive. Likewise, you may have invested in that NFT that turned out to be one of the 5% that did go to the moon.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All I am doing is playing a bit of devil‚Äôs advocate and asking you to analyse your portfolio through a completely impartial and critical lense. The last thing that you want to do is hold a bag through this bear market hoping for a return to bull market highs - all while passing on some of the newest projects building in the space.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs no secret that the vast majority of crypto fans are currently men. That‚Äôs a bit of a shame for overall crypto adoption, as last time I checked, women actually influence or carry out </span><a href="https://girlpowermarketing.com/womens-purchasing-power/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">85% of all retail spending</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs why I think that the increased interest in crypto, amongst women, is important for the long-term growth of the crypto markets.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I am keen to get Coin Bureau ladies' merch into as many hands as possible and that is why my team and I have decided to run a </span><b>flash sale</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a week. So, if you want some ladies merch from the Bureau then now is your chance to bag yourself a </span><b>discount!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ </span><a href="https://store.coinbureau.com/?gender=female"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get that ladies merch!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîÆ </span><b>Video Pipeline</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üîÆ</span></p>

		<Title>How Long Will This Bear Market Last?!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the bear market has indisputably begun, many of you have been asking me how long I think it could last. Is this a temporary shakeout where we will see a recovery in a few months, or is this the beginning of a long and cold crypto winter?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truthfully, the answer is not that clear cut. That‚Äôs because there are so many variables that determine the length and severity of a bear market. And, although we have had crypto bear markets before, the landscape has changed considerably since the 2018 crypto winter.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some factors, such as investor profiles, have improved, but the global macro picture itself is a lot worse today than it was in 2018.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in my video today, I'll be giving you a complete overview of how long this bear market is likely to last. I will break down some of the key things to consider when planning for this market downturn.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also give you my view as to where some of these cryptocurrencies are likely to go when these turbulent times finally end.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxJvZMEYF8w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes to the portfolio this week. Will keep it top heavy in BTC &amp; ETH for the time being. As I mentioned in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider/2006"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week, I would caution against going heavily into alts under these market conditions.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updated portfolio is:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH 39.53% | BTC 34.18% | SOL 5.86% | DOT 5.31% | ATOM 3.30% | RUNE 1.93% | NEAR 1.63% | APE 1.50% | ADA 1.39% | AR 1.20% | MATIC 0.96% | HNT 0.94% | FTM 0.93% | INJ 0.67% | LINK 0.54% | XDEFI 0.12%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there we have it - the 9th straight week of price decline for BTC. It‚Äôs the longest losing streak in Bitcoin‚Äôs history, and it looks like it‚Äôs likely to continue. That‚Äôs because the crypto market has </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-27/bitcoin-extends-worst-losing-streak-since-2011-as-crypto-swoons?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social"><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially decoupled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the stock market, but not in a good way. While the stock market starts to recover, the crypto market continues to crash. So, what the hell is going on? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first possibility is that investors still aren‚Äôt feeling brave enough to take on additional risks by investing in cryptocurrencies. This might have something to do with </span><a href="https://youtu.be/0CutSymg94I"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terra‚Äôs recent collapse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which spooked crypto investors in many different ways. The full extent of the fallout is still being assessed, but the general consensus is that crypto regulations are coming.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second possibility is that individuals and institutions just aren‚Äôt investing as much, be it because of inflation or uncertainty. As per the Federal Reserve‚Äôs </span><a href="https://youtu.be/qtw63xctGGg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there isn‚Äôt all that much money sloshing around in the markets. This leads to increased volatility to both the upside and the downside, which could explain the disconnect between crypto and stocks.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third possibility is that cryptocurrency has entered a bear market, and if you watched today‚Äôs video you‚Äôll know that this certainly seems to be the case. Make no mistake though, crypto isn‚Äôt dead. There are still </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/andreessen-horowitz-closes-4-5-billion-crypto-fund-amid-market-turmoil"><span style="font-weight: 400;">billions of dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pouring in from VCs, and crypto was a hot topic at the World Economic Forum‚Äôs recent conference. We‚Äôll be covering that later this week.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third possibility is the most probable, and we‚Äôre finally starting to see signs of capitulation among altcoins. Not only has Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance increased relative to altcoins, but even Ethereum‚Äôs dominance has started to drop. This seems to be because of </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-beacon-chain-experiences-7-block-reorg-what-s-going-on"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an issue </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that was detected on Ethereum‚Äôs Beacon Chain which might have delayed The Merge.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that The Merge was one of the only big bullish milestones coming up for the crypto market, the prospect of </span><a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1530455080826445824?s=20&amp;t=oQpwyMyedRfx1JwfHV7XSA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a delay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is really dragging down the crypto market. One of the other bullish milestones in the works is the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, but it looks like the SEC isn‚Äôt budging - they recently </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/one-river-s-spot-bitcoin-etf-application-rejected-by-sec"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> another application and a carbon neutral one at that!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, there seems to be lots of FUD floating around about Tether. This is because over 10 billion USDT </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/23/tether-usdt-stablecoin-withdrawals-top-10-billion.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been redeemed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the last couple of weeks. This has led to worries that USDT will fail due to a run on the bank, but I‚Äôm not so convinced. Allow me to explain‚Ä¶&nbsp;</span><b>ü§ì&nbsp; </b><b>Why Tether Is Not A Ticking Time Bomb</b><b> ü§ì</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you all know, USDT is the largest stablecoin by market cap. Just about every single cryptocurrency trades against USDT as the de facto dollar pair. This is why it‚Äôs one of the </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/crypto-top-volume-24hr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most traded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cryptocurrencies, occasionally even surpassing BTC and ETH. It should go without saying then that any problems with USDT would translate to an even bigger problem for cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDT is issued by Tether, a crypto company that hasn‚Äôt been the most transparent about its operations. It also has a </span><a href="https://youtu.be/dPJGZny8kOE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">peculiar relationship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. Tether‚Äôs relative lack of transparency and its association with Bitfinex have landed it in hot water with regulators before, but the bigger issue is the question about the assets backing USDT.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôve watched </span><a href="https://youtu.be/TxcTDNHSS-U"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the assets backing the largest stablecoins, you‚Äôll know that all three (USDT, USDC, BUSD) are backed primarily by different kinds of debt. Whereas USDC and BUSD are mostly backed by government debt, USDT is mostly backed by riskier types of corporate debt. To be fair, Tether has noted that it's </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/97754/tether-promises-continue-cutting-commercial-paper-holdings"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of cutting down this debt.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, the concern here is that the assets backing USDT are harder to sell for the same price at short notice. This means that if too many USDT holders tried to cash out via Tether at the same time, Tether might not have enough US dollars to give them. This concern is a part of why USDT </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/usdt-dollar-peg-wobbles-as-markets-continue-to-struggle-tether-cto-weighs-in"><span style="font-weight: 400;">briefly lost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its dollar peg during Terra‚Äôs implosion - that and regulatory concerns.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned a few moments ago, 10 billion dollars worth of USDT has been redeemed over the last two weeks, and Tether hasn‚Äôt flinched - it's managed to provide dollars to those who demanded them. Not surprisingly, many of those who cashed out seem to have </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-18/circle-s-usd-coin-reaps-the-benefits-of-tether-circulation-drop"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taken their dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Circle and Paxos to mint USDC and BUSD, because these two issuers are regulated.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this is exactly why Tether is not a ticking time bomb - USDT holders are volunarily rotating into stablecoins with more regulatory certainty, and it‚Äôs possible if not likely that this process will continue. Assuming that Tether has enough dollars for USDT holders to cash out (which </span><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sam-bankman-fried-tether-crypto-ftx-bitcoin-stablecoin-miami-fraud-2021-10"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seems to be the case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), then USDT‚Äôs decline will be a slow transition to safety, not a run on the bank.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call me crazy, but I think Tether can see the shift that‚Äôs occurring among stablecoin holders in the crypto market. This is because of all the headlines like </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/other-flavors-of-tether-will-bridge-users-to-usdt-paolo-ardoino"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that talk about how Tether is going to continue expanding and improving etc. This is a rhetoric that I have not heard before, and it‚Äôs a sign that we‚Äôre headed for some interesting times. As if those we're in aren't interesting enough.</span><b>üêª Bear Market Expectations üêª</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we appear to be at the beginning of a bear market, it‚Äôs an important time to take a cold, hard look at your portfolios with a critical eye. That‚Äôs because of the unfortunate reality that some cryptocurrencies, which you thought may have had amazing potential, are unlikely to achieve those previous highs again.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is based purely on previous experience from the 2018-2020 bear market. Prior to that time, there were a number of cryptocurrencies that ranked near the top of CMC, had extensive exchange support and were the staples of many people‚Äôs portfolios.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can view the </span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20171224/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">historical rankings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on CMC for yourself. Some of the cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash, IOTA &amp; DASH reached dizzying highs in the previous bull markets. However, they never reached those highs again.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don't mean to single out these cryptocurrencies, as there are many other coins lower down on the list that also haven‚Äôt recovered. It‚Äôs also not an indictment on a project if the coin or token hasn‚Äôt been able to reach those previous highs again. Sometimes, no matter how much potential a project may have and how amazing its tech is, the market perpetually discounts it.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What this means is that there are likely to be a number of other cryptocurrencies that reached all time highs in the 2021 bull market that are unlikely to recover.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also likely to play out to a large degree in the NFT space. I am of the view that at least 95% of the most highly hyped collections are unlikely to ever recover. During the NFT mania of last year, there was too much saturation and insane speculation, which will lead to capitulation.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now of course, I don‚Äôt know what your portfolio looks like. You may have a solid selection of really promising cryptocurrencies that are likely to outlast this bear market and thrive. Likewise, you may have invested in that NFT that turned out to be one of the 5% that did go to the moon.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All I am doing is playing a bit of devil‚Äôs advocate and asking you to analyse your portfolio through a completely impartial and critical lense. The last thing that you want to do is hold a bag through this bear market hoping for a return to bull market highs - all while passing on some of the newest projects building in the space.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî•</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs no secret that the vast majority of crypto fans are currently men. That‚Äôs a bit of a shame for overall crypto adoption, as last time I checked, women actually influence or carry out </span><a href="https://girlpowermarketing.com/womens-purchasing-power/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">85% of all retail spending</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs why I think that the increased interest in crypto, amongst women, is important for the long-term growth of the crypto markets.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I am keen to get Coin Bureau ladies' merch into as many hands as possible and that is why my team and I have decided to run a </span><b>flash sale</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a week. So, if you want some ladies merch from the Bureau then now is your chance to bag yourself a </span><b>discount!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">üëâ </span><a href="https://store.coinbureau.com/?gender=female"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get that ladies merch!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">üîÆ </span><b>Video Pipeline</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üîÆ</span></p>

		<Title>A Bubble That Everyone IGNORES!!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, people coined the term the ‚Äúeverything bubble‚Äù. Numerous asset classes that were inflated thanks to monetary policy.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently though, as interest rates have started to rise, many of these assets have seen large falls in value. However, there is one asset class that still seems to be holding up - and that is the housing market.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, is it due to follow the same fate as equities or crypto? Or perhaps even worse?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs exactly what I explore in my latest video. I take a look at the global property market and analyse exactly what has been driving the frenzied buying that we have seen in the world‚Äôs hottest markets.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also dissect a recent Fed report which warned of a ‚Äúproperty bubble‚Äù. This report seemed to come out of nowhere and got many market participants worried - were we about to see a great unwind?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in my </span><a href="https://youtu.be/VRrnpU49wus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest video</span></a><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes to the portfolio at the moment and I am quite happy with my top-heavy Bitcoin and Ethereum allocation. Depending on how the markets progress over the next few weeks, I may consider shifting even more weight to these in my portfolio.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will keep you updated in my </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">official telegram channel.&nbsp;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC 39.31% | ETH 35.82% | SOL 5.04% | DOT 4.97% | ATOM 2.92% | RUNE 2.05% | ADA 1.77% | NEAR 1.47% | HNT 1.37% | APE 1.16% | AR 1.08% | MATIC 0.98% | FTM 0.70% | LINK 0.64% | INJ 0.63% | XDEFI 0.10%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs start with Ethereum. There are a few factors that are hitting ETH hard, and the first is the apparent </span><a href="https://twitter.com/parithosh_j/status/1534653289194823685?s=20&amp;t=ngoGbEx6Fgw2cgclc9wSYg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discovery of bugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the Ropsten testnet Merge. For reference, Ropsten is Ethereum‚Äôs longest-running testnet, and doing a simulation of The Merge on Ropsten is one of the final steps before the actual Merge. Or at least, it was.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second factor hitting ETH hard is the official delay of Ethereum‚Äôs difficulty bomb on Friday, something that‚Äôs so significant pp a it was picked up </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-10/ethereum-s-difficulty-bomb-delay-is-bad-news-for-its-revamp%5C"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Bloomberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is because the difficulty bomb is meant to force proof-of-work miners off of the network in preparation of proof of stake. Logically, another delay of 2.5 months means The Merge might be delayed.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ties into the third factor hitting ETH hard, and that‚Äôs the depegging of tokenised staked ETH or stETH offered by </span><a href="https://youtu.be/VQ_uvak1JPw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lido Finance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As reported by </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-contagion-analysts-warn-of-staked-ether-de-pegging-from-ethereum-by-50"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinTelegraph</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, stETH‚Äôs use in apps like Celsius and DeFi protocols like Aave means a depegging could create serious issues for the crypto market. FYI, there‚Äôs over 4.1M ETH </span><a href="https://dune.com/LidoAnalytical/Lido-Finance-Extended"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Lido</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and stETH is 5% </span><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/151380/lido-staked-ether-steth-discount-drops-to-5-for-second-time-in-one-month"><span style="font-weight: 400;">below its peg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides that mentioned above, there are additional macro factors that have been moving the crypto market and if you watched our</span><a href="https://youtu.be/XGXJSVV52WY"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recent video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about that you‚Äôll know which ones I‚Äôm talking about. One of these is the release of the inflation figures for May in the United States via the CPI. Not surprisingly, the CPI came in at </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/10/us-inflation-rate-may-2022-four-decade-high"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another historical high</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What‚Äôs funny is that the market was reportedly pricing in a CPI of around 8.2%, which is optimistic because producer inflation was a </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/12/wholesale-inflation-rose-11percent-in-april-as-producer-prices-keep-accelerating.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">whopping 11%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in April and producer inflation tends to be a leading indicator for consumer inflation. The next producer inflation reading comes in next week, specifically Tuesday June 14th, so be </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/ppi.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the lookout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another macro factor that‚Äôs been moving the crypto market is the belief that the Fed is going to raise interest rates even more aggressively in response to all the inflation I just mentioned. The Fed will be announcing </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-10/fed-seen-extending-steep-rate-hike-path-to-cool-heated-inflation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how much it plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on raising interest rates during its press conference this week, specifically Wednesday June 15th, so get ready for more volatility.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There‚Äôs also been a lot of chatter about incoming energy and food shortages all around the world, starting with </span><a href="https://time.com/6184189/sri-lanka-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sri Lanka</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where there isn‚Äôt even enough ink for students to complete exams. An </span><a href="https://youtu.be/W5zxYDHwf-Y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interesting video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the crisis predicts that Pakistan will be the next domino to fall, followed by the countries I mentioned in my own video </span><a href="https://youtu.be/EdkJj2KyNi4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about the subject</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For what it‚Äôs worth, on-chain analytics suggest that BTC accumulation continues, as BTC </span><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=distribution.BalanceExchangesRelative&amp;s=1573773682&amp;u=1654905600&amp;zoom="><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaves exchanges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for crypto wallets. It also looks like Bitcoin miners have almost </span><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=distribution.BalanceMinersChange&amp;s=1573773682&amp;u=1654905600&amp;zoom="><span style="font-weight: 400;">stopped selling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their BTC, which could provide some relief to the crypto market. Historically, BTC has seen a rally after Bitcoin miners stopped selling BTC, so let‚Äôs hope it happens this time too.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôll end with a little more optimism from </span><a href="https://youtu.be/rhVu0704h0E"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a recent video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by one of </span><a href="https://youtu.be/LoWOO3GtUBY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my favourite</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crypto YouTubers, Bob Loukas. Bob believes that we‚Äôre likely to see the bottom of the crypto bear market later this year or early next year, which is more or less in line with our own crypto bear market </span><a href="https://youtu.be/WxJvZMEYF8w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prediction video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You know what that means‚Ä¶ get ready to accumulate!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî® </span><b>Bitcoin Fixes This</b><b> üî®</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other day I was having a discussion with one of my colleagues here at the Coin Bureau, and we came to an interesting realisation. This might sound crazy, but most if not all the problems we‚Äôre seeing today - climate issues, war, inequality, inflation, and even the increasing totalitarianism of governments - are due to fiat currencies.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow me to explain‚Ä¶&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There‚Äôs an idea in economics called the ‚Äúmisallocation of resources‚Äù. As the term suggests, the misallocation of resources is when money isn‚Äôt being allocated in an efficient way. In other words, it's when money is spent on useless, or even harmful things. There is arguably no shortage of this happening today, and that‚Äôs for one reason: money printing.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When currencies were backed by gold, there was a sort of limit on how much money could be created. This meant that there was a huge incentive for the allocation of this limited capital to be efficient as possible. Interestingly, we see a </span><a href="https://medium.com/element-finance/unlocking-capital-efficiency-a-defi-users-journey-through-element-d0a689f2a894"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar dynamic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in cryptocurrency today, notably DeFi, probably for the same reason (constraints of coin and token supply).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When currencies stopped being backed by hard assets like gold, all of a sudden there was no limit to how much money could be created. This meant there was, at the very least, less incentive to allocate capital efficiently. When you add inflation to the mix, this means there‚Äôs also less incentive to hold currency for very long, which accelerates capital inefficiency.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This second idea lies at the heart of Jeff Booth‚Äôs famous book, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/w_w-Kij5mag"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Price of Tomorrow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which I highly recommend. In short, inflation incentivizes people to spend rather than save. This leads to the sort of overconsumption that causes the climate issues we‚Äôre facing today. This is where things get a little complicated, so bear with me.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, a question: why is there inflation in the first place?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth there are many reasons, but I want to focus on one: government debt. It‚Äôs long been said that the US government has used inflation to shrink the actual value of all the debt it owes. Why do governments have so much debt? Ultimately, capital inefficiency caused by the ability to create money on demand.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here‚Äôs the thing, it‚Äôs not just the government that gets caught up in this capital inefficiency. Wealthy individuals and institutions see the inflationary conditions, and, assuming interest rates are low enough, realise they can borrow large amounts of money to buy real assets which they can then borrow against, hence the term</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk_iEdHieSc"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buy, borrow, die</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As time goes on, the individuals and institutions closest to the money printer (the central bank) become wealthier and wealthier, be it because they have access to lower interest rates or have some secret dealings with the central bank and government officials. As far as I can tell, this is fundamentally what has led to the massive wealth divide </span><a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we see today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wealth divide has led to an increase in domestic and international conflicts, which makes sense given that it's not poverty that causes crime, but </span><a href="https://youtu.be/M3XYHPAwBzE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relative poverty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Consider for a moment that even investment trends like </span><a href="https://youtu.be/zVxiFEzCp2U"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ESG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wouldn‚Äôt be possible were it not for the capital inefficiency coming from the on-demand creation of fiat currencies.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, if an asset like BTC does become the world‚Äôs next </span><a href="https://youtu.be/QcXIwytY5qM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reserve currency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this would solve many of the issues we‚Äôre seeing today, simply because these issues are being driven by capital inefficiencies being caused by the ability to create currencies. This technically makes BTC the most ESG-friendly asset, but it would put the likes of Blackrock out of business.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can‚Äôt have that, can we?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ü§Ø </span><b>Buidl That Knowledge ü§Ø</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people talk about using a bear market as an opportunity to ‚Äúbuidl‚Äù. This isn‚Äôt only true of protocols and technology, but also </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1534955369012809736"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for knowledge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is in these times of less hype, FOMO and volatility that real learning can take hold.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, there are a few resources and tips I wanted to share with you to best guide you in ‚Äúbuidling‚Äù that Giga crypto brain.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, if you haven‚Äôt already, I highly encourage you to read the </span><a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin whitepaper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are only ever going to read one whitepaper in your life, then this is it. That‚Äôs because, not only is it relatively easy to follow, but it also lays the foundational principles that underlie crypto‚Äôs tech and use cases.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If what you read is intriguing and you want to learn more about the tech backing your favourite projects, then you should also consider going over their whitepapers too. Yes, some of these can be pretty long and a chore to read, but there is a way to skim through it and get most of the important information - see </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63BIv0oQjg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my video on it.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, however, you cannot face reading a white paper, then there are plenty of books out there that will definitely help. I still regularly read crypto-related books and I have talked about them on a number of occasions, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DwlQIo8X0Q"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POyvcLCIHTE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1527976627161923585"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Part of the reason why I think reading in bear markets is so much easier is because it‚Äôs one of those things that can take you away from the PC - one less excuse to refresh CMC or check prices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something else that you can do that doesn‚Äôt require using your computer is to listen to some crypto podcasts. It‚Äôs a great medium for cramming knowledge in when on the move, relaxing or even just doing the chores. Apart from doing </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/41TtLE0AKsokP5XBbSoLwe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my own podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I am a massive fan of them in general and have talked about the best podcasts to listen to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1529130376463011840"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ardvij3wQ1g"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it‚Äôs not just about what you should be focusing on, but also what you should </span><b>be avoiding.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can be certain that over the next few weeks and months, the mainstream media is going to dial up the crypto FUD to the max. We have already got a flavour of this as regulators and politicians attempt to ramp up the pressure. It can be tough to completely tune out headlines as they try to gaslight you about the future of crypto - but you have to try.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very little ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù crypto news that is being pushed right now will change the underlying fundamentals and broader use cases. They are unlikely to change the longer-term trajectory and potential of the industry. So, it‚Äôs important to tune out the FUD because the more attention you give it, the more likely these outlets are to reward you with more FUD.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, a bear market is a great opportunity to buidl those longer-term relationships with other people in the space. Now that the pandemic is (we hope) a thing of the past, we should use the opportunity to grow our crypto networks. Getting together with fellow cryptopians is a great way to share knowledge and get some other points of view. I love nothing better than talking crypto with people and getting their take on things.

		<Title><![CDATA[Are China's GDP Numbers Fake?]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that China‚Äôs GDP could overtake that of the USA‚Äôs by 2030?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs thanks to the current growth trends we have been seeing over the past few years. However, can these numbers really be trusted? Is China‚Äôs GDP really 73% of that of the USA?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that‚Äôs what I will be exploring in my video today. I will be peeling back the curtain on those Chinese GDP numbers and analysing exactly how their data is collected. I will also be diving into numerous research reports that have studied China‚Äôs questionable statistics over the years.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These numbers have really important implications for transparency in the global economy and I hope that my video today can shed some light on them.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can watch that </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jO1G4CNse8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here.&nbsp;</span></a><b>üìä Main Portfolio üìä</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given how deep we are in this bear market, I have decided to close out my position in some altcoins and decrease my exposure in others. I think that we are in for a longer period of uncertainty and in these times, I prefer to be top heavy in BTC &amp; ETH. I will also move some of the proceeds of that sale into stablecoins.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I might make even more portfolio moves due to market conditions. If you want to be kept up to date with that then jump into </span><a href="https://t.me/cbinsider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my Telegram group!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC 36.89% | ETH 33.64% | USDC 7.79% | SOL 5.26% | DOT 4.95% | ATOM 2.71% | HNT 1.73% | ADA 1.70% | RUNE 1.50% | NEAR 1.26% | FTM 0.72% | MATIC 0.71% | LINK 0.64% | INJ 0.51%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üìà </span><b>Thoughts on Market üìà</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what they call a ‚Äòdeleveraging‚Äô. In simple terms, everyone who borrowed to invest in crypto - be it by taking out fiat loans with their bank or crypto-backed loans with DeFi protocols - are getting absolutely rekt. Those who borrowed from exchanges to speculate on the short term price action of crypto got even more rekt, with </span><a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2022/06/14/over-1300000000-in-crypto-liquidated-in-last-24-hours-as-bitcoin-threatens-to-breach-20000/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at least $1.3 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lost.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under normal conditions, these liquidations wouldn‚Äôt do that much damage to the crypto market, because there would be enough buyers around to absorb the sell pressure - ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù, as they say. If you watched </span><a href="https://youtu.be/qtw63xctGGg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the Federal Reserve‚Äôs financial stability report however, you‚Äôll know that all markets are missing buyers as everyone HODLs fiat.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiat HODLing is finally starting to happen in crypto too, and I say finally because BTC is generally considered to be the safe haven (relative to altcoins at least). This is why it took me by surprise when Bitcoin dominance suddenly dropped, without altcoin dominance increasing. CoinMarketCap </span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reveals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a flight to fiat - to stablecoins like USDT and USDC.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first time I‚Äôve seen this in a while, and it tells me that investors are expecting a lot more pain in the crypto market. Many were expecting the previous bull market highs of 18-20k to hold for BTC, but we sliced through 20k like butter. Some </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ved6wo/we_are_below_2017_ath_if_you_factor_in_inflation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are arguing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that this is because we were already below the previous high when you factor in inflation.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre wondering why the crypto market is collapsing, you probably missed our video about </span><a href="https://youtu.be/XGXJSVV52WY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">macro factors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be on the lookout for. In this case it‚Äôs the Federal Reserve raising interest rates by 0.75%, the highest rate hike since 1994. The markets also seem to believe that the Fed will be more hawkish than it‚Äôs letting on, leading to losses across the board.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre wondering when we could finally see the volatility start to decline, I‚Äôm afraid this is unlikely to happen anytime soon. It looks like regulators are trying to capitalise on the crypto crash by using it </span><a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-chief-advises-caution-to-crypto-investors-as-market-weakness-extends/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as justification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a crackdown. The irony of course is that everything else is crashing too, yet you don‚Äôt see calls for stricter regulation there, do you?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto investors also seem to be on edge about the possibility (if not the likelihood) that the SEC will reject Grayscale‚Äôs </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/103178/gbtc-discount-hits-all-time-low-as-sec-bitcoin-etf-decision-looms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spot Bitcoin ETF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> application. The decision date is set for July 6th, and a rejection could dash the hopes of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved for the foreseeable future. Conversely, an approval could keep the crypto markets afloat.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre all wondering now is where exactly the bottom is, and this is a question I will be answering to the best of my ability later this week. All I‚Äôll say for now is that I think the bottom will be marked by some sort of catalyst - be it a spot Bitcoin ETF rejection or some kind of regulatory crackdown. Regardless, the bear market is likely to last </span><a href="https://youtu.be/WxJvZMEYF8w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a while</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless‚Ä¶&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî® </span><b>The Third Option</b><b> üî®</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given how much macro factors have been moving the markets these days, I‚Äôve found myself listening to the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BlockWorksGroup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockworks Macro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> YouTube channel quite a bit. They have some of the most interesting guests and discussions of any podcast, and though what they discuss can and often does fly over my head, there‚Äôs an interesting pattern that I‚Äôve noticed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, the macro guys are falling into one of two camps: the Fed will continue raising interest rates until something breaks, at which point it‚Äôll be forced to reverse course. Or, the Fed will continue to raise interest rates regardless of what happens in the market or the economy, because tackling inflation is the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/DPE5D7X3N7U"><span style="font-weight: 400;">number one issue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and will remain so indefinitely.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chances are that you fall into one of these two camps too, and for a long time I was torn between which camp I fall into, because I‚Äôm not convinced that either of these views are correct. As it so happens, a discussion at the World Economic Forum‚Äôs Davos conference a couple weeks ago (which we covered </span><a href="https://youtu.be/I6lma4DXqok"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by the way) seems to suggest there is a third option here.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I just mentioned, the Fed is fundamentally raising interest rates to fight inflation. If inflation comes down, then the Fed will stop raising interest rates, or possibly even start lowering them again. This will cause all markets to rally, including crypto. Right now the consensus is that inflation is going to stick around for years, but again, I‚Äôm not convinced.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is for two reasons. The first reason is that as time goes on, more and more of the inflation we‚Äôre experiencing is not as a result of the Fed‚Äôs money printing, but a result of factors that are causing issues on the supply side. The two elephants in the room here are the war in Ukraine, and the pandemic we‚Äôre still technically in (with autumn approaching).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned in last week‚Äôs </span><a href="https://youtu.be/raB6UGw8lks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is intense pressure on politicians around the world because of inflation, and this is starting to translate into pressure for them to resolve the war in Ukraine and convince the WHO to declare an end to the pandemic. An inability to do so almost certainly means serious instability elsewhere in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lo and behold, many Western media outlets are </span><a href="https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1537796376335110144?s=20&amp;t=JEh9ylkvr_7j0eQddFXYcg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">starting to report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Western leaders are pressuring Ukraine‚Äôs president into negotiating with Russia to end the conflict.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings me to the second reason, and that‚Äôs </span><b>perception</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Again, right now the consensus is that inflation is going to stick around for years. This is arguably contributing to inflation today as it leads to</span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/10/business/consumer-sentiment-preliminary-june-inflation/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> behavioural changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in preparation for such a future. But what happens when two primary sources of inflation are suddenly removed from this assumed roadmap?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, individuals and institutions alike will adjust their behaviour knowing that the inflationary forces that were initially forecast to remain have suddenly been removed. In other words, we could see inflation decline rapidly almost overnight despite the fact that the fundamentals haven‚Äôt changed yet, simply because of the drastic change in perception.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This in turn would cause the Fed to stop its interest rate increases or even bring interest rates back down, which will bring life back to the markets without the fear of hyperinflation. I must stress that this is speculation based on circumstantial evidence, at least for the time being. I reckon it‚Äôs best to prepare for the worst, as many have already failed to do‚Ä¶&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ü§Ø </span><b>We Have Come Full Circle ü§Ø</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days ago, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1537666754473861120"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how crypto has come full circle. What was once meant to be the solution to the reckless status quo of TradeFi casinos has become just another gamblig den. Like Obi-Wan discovering that Anakin </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBAdbxjbTM0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has joined the dark side</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, crypto was supposed to fight Wall Street greed - not join it!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What has become increasingly clear over the past few days is that the institutional adoption that we thought would tame the crypto market, has in fact made it a lot more risky. Large VCs, hedge funds and lenders have taken outsized risks and levered themselves up to the neck. They have amplified this further by their interconnected nature, which has led to collateral damage throughout.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was perhaps best illustrated this week with the collapse of Three Arrows Capital. It was one of the most well-known names in crypto. It had over $10 billion in AuM and had invested in hundreds of companies and projects in the crypto space. Not only that, but it also engaged in risky DeFi yield-generating strategies, levered crypto bets and other market-making activities.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So trusted was the firm that other participants used its </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Danny8BC/status/1537224378554806272"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trading accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and crypto protocols used it to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1537526719774658561"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manage their treasuries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What they didn‚Äôt know was how much leverage 3AC was taking on and how quickly the house of cards would collapse. It is the crypto equivalent of Lehman Brothers with too much ‚ÄúAAA Rated‚Äù mortgage debt on its books.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You probably already know by now that 3AC imploded and has gone from over $10bn in AuM </span><a href="https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1537664249744465920"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to 1bn in debt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has also ghosted its counterparties and has had its positions </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/126d8b02-f06a-4fd9-a57b-9f4ceab3de71"><span style="font-weight: 400;">liquidated at lenders.&nbsp;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, what is scaring most people (including myself) is the risk of broader contagion that could come from 3AC‚Äôs collapse. It‚Äôs hard to know exactly who was exposed to it and how these companies will have to adjust their positions based on this. How much further could the rot spread?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope to be doing a deep dive into the 3AC collapse in the coming days. There are so many layers to this story and it keeps evolving every day.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, having said all of this, there is one silver lining to this saga and that is that it was caused by the greed of men, not by the underlying technology. Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamentals remain unchanged. Open and transparent DeFi protocols have continued to function in a completely permissionless manner. Onchain liquidations are tough to watch, but at least they function as intended.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Builders are bruised, but they will get back to doing what they were born to do. 3AC will be a sacrifice, and so will those who it drags down with it. But, it‚Äôs a sacrifice that will help remind us exactly why we started this crypto journey in the first place.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">üî• </span><b>Deal of The Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> üî•</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know that it‚Äôs been a terrible week in crypto markets and, on top of that, </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-17/crypto-lender-babel-follows-celsius-in-withdrawal-freeze-on-rout"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celsius has frozen withdrawals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That goes to show why it‚Äôs incredibly important to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1537837112501968900"><span style="font-weight: 400;">practice self custody</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you want to take control of your crypto and not run the risk that centralised entities can freeze your funds, you want to take control over your private keys.
